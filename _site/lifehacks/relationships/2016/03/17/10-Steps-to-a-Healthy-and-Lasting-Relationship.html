<p>Good relationships don’t just happen – they take time, commitment, patience and two people who truly want to be together.</p>

<p>Given the human need to be in a healthy, peaceful and loving relationship; it is unfortunate how we often miss the opportunity to this indulge in one because of our myopic views on love and romance. A successful and lasting relationship is no stroll in the park and unrealistic expectation set it up for failure – Healthy relationships are made of two real people, and not perfect images, striving to survive in real life circumstances and challenges, thus it is prone to due friction. However, it can be made blissful by following a simple rule: Appreciate the similarities, respect the differences and be there for each other.</p>

<p>Lets begin by describing a healthy relationship and what it takes to ensure its longevity:</p>

<p><strong>What is a healthy relationship?</strong></p>

<p>A healthy relationship is characterized by mutual respect, equality, trust, communication and freedom. Each person is allowed to be an individual within the relationship while they grow together as a couple. Here is a plan to make it last:</p>

<h5 id="be-each-others-best-friend">1. Be each other’s best friend:</h5>

<p>The cornerstone of any romantic relationship is ingrained in true and honest friendship. This means that you are allowed to be your imperfectly perfect self while enjoying each other’s presence and company. You are able to make each other laugh and find joy in doing the simplest of things: making dinner, sharing jokes or finishing each others sentences …
You do little things for each other while not feeling the pressure of trying too hard to please your partner. You feel secure in each other’s presence and look forward to the time together. You keep your life balanced while not over loading each other with tasks and responsibilities and sharing the burden when you can.</p>

<h5 id="be-each-others-strongest-support-system">2. Be each other’s strongest support system:</h5>

<p>Your relationship should be a safety net and a source of strength and courage for both partners in good times and bad. You find strength in knowing you are not alone to fight your battles and someone is always there to hold your hand during the challenging route to success. You hold each other to the same standard and encourage each other’s independence and goals. Make each other better and stronger – challenge each other to go beyond average and pull out the greatness from with in. Such a partnership makes the route to your visions and dreams so much more easier.</p>

<h5 id="have-good-and-open-communication">3. Have good and open communication:</h5>

<p>A comfortable and loyal relationship requires that both partners practice open and honest communication. When you have issues or concerns, you share them with your partner, not your Facebook friends.  It is critical to keep your promises, tell the truth and be dependable.  It helps to talk a little less and listen more.</p>

<p>In a healthy relationship, “There is a safe and open exchange of ideas, feelings and thoughts and all prospectives are considered valuable. There is also the freedom to respectfully challenge, confront and strengthen one and another.” – Leslie Vernick</p>

<h5 id="give-each-other-space">4. Give each other space:</h5>

<p>It is extremely important to not suffocate your partner by unnecessarily invading each other’s privacy or space. Setting boundaries is a way of caring for yourself and your partner at the same time. It doesn’t make you mean, selfish or uncaring because you do things your way – it means you care for each other’s individuality. Boundaries do not have to be melodramatic or forceful in application – They can be completely silent and just as steadfast as refusing to engage in a useless argumentation.  In the absence of realistic and reasonable boundaries, you may find yourself angry, resentful, dissatisfied and exhausted.</p>

<h5 id="keep-conflict-at-a-minimum">5. Keep conflict at a minimum:</h5>

<p>It is said that a relationship with no arguments is a relationship with a lot of secrets, however, what’s crucial to a healthy relationship is that you leave petty arguments alone. Pick you battles and fight fair, don’t unnecessarily criticize, stay with the topic, say “I’m sorry” when you are wrong, don’t assume things and ask for help when you need it.  Avoid unconstructive and harmful commentary and acknowledge/respect the difference of opinion.</p>

<p>Don’t hesitate to apologize when you are at fault - Apologizing does not always mean you are wrong and the other person is right – it means you value your relationship more than your ego.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-try-to-change-each-other">6. Do not try to change each other:</h5>

<p>One of the biggest reasons for failed relationships is that people make unreasonable and unnecessary efforts to change each other. Although it always helps to be flexible and improve upon our selves as better partners, we need to be realistic in our expectations. No one can be everything we might want them to be, so accept people just the way they are – Look past their short comings and try to appreciate the goodness within them.</p>

<h5 id="make-time-for-meaningful-intimacy">7. Make time for meaningful intimacy:</h5>

<p>Sex is an important part of any healthy relationship, but its intimacy, which strengthens the bond of affection and commitment. While sex is about physical satisfaction, intimacy is focused on emotional and physical bonding that both partners nurture and experience in each other’s presence, touch, smell and warmth.</p>

<h5 id="be-forgiving-and-patient">8. Be forgiving and patient:</h5>

<p>While mild friction and argumentation are typical phenomenon of any relationship, it is important that both partners practice forgiveness and willingness to move forward. Mistakes will always be made along the way as learning lessons that only help to improve as loving partners, it is important to understand that no two human beings are completely alike – Thus, it helps to practice genuine forgiveness and learn to leave the past in the past.</p>

<h5 id="make-decisions-jointly">9. Make decisions jointly:</h5>

<p>Healthy relationships mean change and growth are allowed which implies that nothing is set in stone when it comes to decision-making. While it is perfectly permissible for both partners to make their own choices, it is preferable that decisions impacting their common well-being be made with complete agreement and coordination. People in general feel more committed to the outcome of the decision making, if they are involved during the process of evaluating the choices and making the selection. Hence, neither of the partners is burdened with un-due blame if both are involved in joint decision making.</p>

<h5 id="say-the-magic-words">10. Say the magic words:</h5>

<p>“I Love you”, “Thank You” and “I am Sorry” – it’s just as simple as that!</p>

<p>In summary, a healthy relationship means you come together to make each other better – realize it is a process that requires commitment to making an investment of loyalty, affection and dedication.</p>
