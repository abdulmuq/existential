If you are anticipating the 2016 update to the 12-inch MacBook to be the smallest, most powerful device possible at an affordable price tag, you are highly mistaken. While MacBook Air is highly portable, it lacks a powerful processor – In contrast, the MacBook Pro is powerful but not light enough. With the new MacBook, Apple fans were hoping the portability of a MacBook with the power of a MacBook Pro, at the price tag of a MacBook Air, while the new model fails to meet these expectations across the board – On a positive note, you could get a hideous ‘Pink’ PC, if you’d like …

Some of the new specs included in the new MacBook are as follows: Upgraded processor, faster RAM, and improved graphics to give the new MacBook a well-needed bump in performance. Then what leads to my disappointment?


Here are my top 5 reasons:

1. Despite the potential for decent performance, the 12-inch MacBook’s comes at a hefty price tag of $1,299. This is still way too high relative to its specs. You'd be paying a huge premium purely for the luxury of slim design and ultra-light weight.

2. You can actually buy a 13 inch MacBook Pro at the same price tag, that runs on a Core i5 processor, that is much more powerful than the Core m processor in the new MacBook. If you want to save your self $300, you could buy a MacBook air that is also significantly more powerful than the new MacBook. 

3. Then there are plenty of reasonably priced Windows 10 laptops out there that are not quite as light or slim as the MacBook, but they come pretty close, not to mention the Windows 10 operating system is a massive bonus in itself. The $800 13-inch LG Gram, for example weights very close to the MacBook and runs on the superior Core i5 processor, with a larger 13-inch screen.  
4.  The Face Time camera on the new MacBook is still at an unimpressive 480p resolution. A laptop with such hefty price tag should at least come equip with a HD web cam for a sharper, more clearer video chat. 

5. The new MacBook still has a single USB-C port. Worse, the single USB-C port isn't even Thunderbolt 3. If we're going to have to make do with only one USB-C port, at least make the fastest one available.
