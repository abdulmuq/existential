Anxiety attack is a sudden and often unexpected feeling of panic, fear, anxiety or restlessness. It can be very over whelming and often show symptoms of rapid or uncomfortable breathing, racing heartbeat, sweating, dizziness or lack of balance.

The most important factor to understand in an attempt to deal with panic attacks is to identify and acknowledge the underlying cause of anxiety – it could be a person, situation or a merely a worrying thought. Once the trigger is identified, of course the right course of action is to address and resolve the underlying cause or seek medical help, if needed.

Luckily, it is possible to address this situation in the interim, by incorporating a few habits into your daily lifestyle. These techniques are helpful to combat the onset of a anxiety attack and regular practice could help minimize attacks all together, as you master the skill of controlling your daily stress and anxiety levels. 

Here are a few simple, but highly effective techniques:

#####1. Engage in Self-Talk:

Address the situation in your mind by walking away to a quite place for a few minutes. Sit your self down in a comfortable spot and have a brief self-talk. Ask the following questions to your self to understand the cause and severity of the attack:

1. Is the situation on hand really that stressful or am I exaggerating the intensity of the situation?
2. Does it need to be addressed immediately or could I deal with it at a later time?
3. What are the choices at hand to address the situation?
4. Is the reason behind the stress under my control – If not, there is no sense in worrying about things that are not under your control.

Tell your self the following:

1. This situation will not last forever.
2. This feeling is temporary and will pass shortly.
3. This is not the end of the world.
4. Tell the worrying noise in your head to shut up.

#####2. Distract yourself with a Good thought:

Mostly there is a voice inside of our head that is promoting the negative feeling and forcing us to worry unnecessarily. It may divert our attention to focus on an unpleasant experience of the past or unnecessary anticipation of the future.  It makes you worry about the should have, could have and would have in your life, which is nothing more than sources of anxiety. 

Follow the following course of action to combat the negativity of this voice:

1. Acknowledge the existence of this voice inside your head.
2. Tell it to shut up and that it is not needed!
3. Divert your attention to something positive – perhaps picture the face of a person you adore, close your eyes and experience a peaceful scenic image, re-experience a happy moment of your past in your mind, or engage your thoughts into planning a happy future event.

These positive thoughts your kill the negative voice in your head and distract your mind by a peaceful and happy thought.

#####3. Practice Meditation:

Taking the time out for meditation could have huge benefits to control anxiety attacks. Find yourself a peaceful and quite spot, close your eyes and focus on your breathing, empty your mind of all thoughts and try to keep your focus on an object or thought. Any time you feel your mind is wondering off, refocus your attention and try to hold the focus for as long as you can. Imagine and feel the worrying thought escaping your mind and body as you exhale. Be in the moment and enjoy the feeling of being worry free. It may take some practice to master the skill of mindfulness through meditation, but the benefits are endless.

#####4. Engage in meaningful Intimacy:

It is scientifically proven that maintaining a healthy and consistent sex life could be hugely beneficial in minimizing anxiety attacks. Meaningful intimacy helps in two ways:

1. The factor of companionship with a significant other gives us the emotional and psychological reassurance that we are not alone. We have someone in our lives that care for us and we can hold on to them in times when we feel anxious. We trust their advice and appreciate their presence in our lives. This factor alone is greatly beneficial in keeping out anxiety levels in check.

2. The benefits associated with physical intimacy are undeniable in this regard as well. Sex is known to decrease stress levels by relaxing the mind and body, resulting in a more peaceful and well-rested well being. So go on, enjoy sex more often …
