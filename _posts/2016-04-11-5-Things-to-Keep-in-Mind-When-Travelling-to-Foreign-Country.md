Are you feeling burnt out?

Planning to take some time off from your busy schedule and travel to a foreign country?

If yes, then read further on what key things you should keep in mind before travelling to a foreign country.

A vacation can be a great way to relax and enjoy time with family. However, it takes a lot of planning or else it can turn into a nightmare.

#####1. Important Documents

First and foremost, make sure you are ready with passport, flight tickets and visa (if required). You must also carry your license, identification proofs of all family members and hotel room booking receipts. Make sure that they are valid up to date. Also, see if government has issued any warning before travelling to the destination country.

#####2. Money

You will need local currency to make purchases in cash. So, check out the currency rates and estimate your expenditure. Carry cash accordingly. It would be a good idea to keep little extra than required so that you can manage well in case of an emergency.

#####3. Transportation

Considering you will be far off from your home, you will need a vehicle to see places around. Before renting a car or a campervan, make sure you know how you will be billed. Check out fuel rates, insurance and maintenance costs apart from rental charges. You should be aware of traffic rules and take necessary measures for your safety.
For example, in US, people drive cars with steering on left side, but in many Asian countries, cars with steering on right side are used.

In case you donâ€™t find it easy to rent a car, you can depend on public transportation. In any case, do your homework properly and make sure your journey will be safe and comfortable.

#####4. Cultural Sensitivity

There are times when you find something absolutely normal in your country, but it might not be acceptable at all in your destination country. If possible, take out some time to know and understand the cultural differences between the two countries.

You should also be able to speak frequently used words in local language of your destination country. Keep dictionary, maps and photographs handy while you travel. There are many resources and tools available online which can make translation easy for you. However, if you find a foreign language too difficult to understand, arrange a local tour guide beforehand who will take you around for sightseeing.

#####5. Cell Phones

You may have just bought the latest smartphone, but chances are it may not work in a foreign country without a specific adapter and local network operator card. Also, keep handy a diary with important contact numbers (what if you lose your phone!).

Hope above tips will help you plan your travel to foreign country better.

Happy holidaying!
