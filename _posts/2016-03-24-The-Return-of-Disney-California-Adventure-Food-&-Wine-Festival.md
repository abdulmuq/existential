This spring season, celebrate the delights of California cuisine, wine and beverages at Disney California Adventure Food & Wine Festival from April 1 to May 1, 2016.

It’s time for foodies to rejoice after six years break as the famous food and wine festival returns with mouth-watering dishes and unique beverages as well as special experiences for guests to enjoy.

In festivals held from 2006 to 2010, food booths, as present in Epcot International Food & Wine Festival, Walt Disney World, Florida, were missing. But this time, Disney California is planning to introduce 6 marketplace kiosks with small plate servings, mini desserts, and beverages.

Admission is included with park passes, but you'll have to pay a la carte for the food items and beverages. Though the park will hold the festival daily, but some of the features are scheduled only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

There will be culinary demonstrations by the best chefs in the industry, including some of your favorites from the Disneyland Resort, will take place on the Backlot Stage in Hollywood Land. With 30-minute complimentary presentations, you have a chance to learn new technique.

In case you want to quench your thirst for knowledge about wine, beer and spirits, you can visit Sonoma Terrace at the Golden Vine Winery. The 45-minute seminars include up to 3 tastings. Cost is $15 per person plus tax.

California's celebrated wines, including flights of cabernet, chardonnay, and pinot noir, will be featured at The Vineyard, while The Brewhouse will offer California craft beer flights.

Disney California Adventure Restaurants will offer festival-inspired food items. For instance, Pacific Wharf Café will offer Dungeness Crab Corn Chowder served in a Boudin sourdough boule and Cocina Cucamonga Mexican Grill will serve Shredded Pork Tostadas with grilled pineapple slaw and chipotle crèma.

Celebrity kitchen will be held at Stage 17 in Hollywood Land. World-renowned chefs Guy Fieri, Graham Elliot, Claudia Sandoval, Keegan Gerhard, Robert Irvine and Disneyland Resort Executive Chef Andrew Sutton will share their tips, treasured recipes and behind-the-scenes-stories. They will also show you how to create their personal favorite dishes. An autograph signing will follow each chef appearance. Cost is $99 per person, plus tax and gratuity.

Disneyland Resort Annual Passholders will enjoy a special Celebrity Kitchen VIP Experience, which includes premium seating, priority access for the autograph session, plus a special gift. Cost is $149 plus tax and gratuity.

Apart from that, you can celebrate springtime in beautiful California with lots to learn about gardening, horticulture and health & wellness at Lifestyle seminars, Hollywood Land.
