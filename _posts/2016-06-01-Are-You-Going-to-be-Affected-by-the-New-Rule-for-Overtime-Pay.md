The U.S. Labor Department on Wednesday confirmed a new rule that's expected to make an additional 4.2 million salaried workers eligible for overtime pay.

The Obama administration on Tuesday unveiled a long-awaited rule that will make millions of low and middle income Americans newly eligible for overtime pay. It is expected that the new move will make 4.2 million additional workers eligible to receive time-and-a-half wages for each hour they work beyond 40 hours/week.

#####Do you qualify for the new rule for overtime pay?

The new rule would double the threshold at which executive, administrative and professional employees are exempt from overtime pay to $47,476 from the current $23,660. 

This Labor Department [fact sheet](https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime/fs17a_overview.pdf) explains the job requirements to meet the overtime exemption. That potentially makes eligible an additional 8.9 million workers now misclassified, like certain administrative employees who don’t supervise anyone. Workers need to perform very specific duties to meet the overtime exemption. For instance, performing executive duties means supervision of the work of two or more employees and administrative duties requires discretion and independent judgment, amongst other criteria. 

#####What is the effect of new rule for overtime pay on employers?

There has been mixed reactions from the employers regarding the new rule for overtime pay. While some businesses welcome the move, many believe it will force them to restructure salaries to get around the regulation. Many companies expect to convert salaried workers to hourly employees who will need to log their hours.

Some employers will likely maintain salaried employees, but will still have to watch their hours and pay extra for putting more than 40 hours/week. Others may lift workers' base pay to the new threshold to avoid paying overtime.

Small businesses who can’t bear the extra expense, will ask employees not to work more than 40 hours, and put part-time workers to work.

Trey Kovacs, policy analyst with the Competitive Enterprise Institute says, “The Obama rule puts a huge cost and regulatory burden on employers, who will face pressure to cut back on benefits and full-time employees.” 

#####Is the new rule for overtime pay a good thing or bad thing?

Overall, it is designed to be a good thing for workers, as they will get paid for all the hours they put in extra after 40 hours. But for some, it might mean losing certain benefits and prestige, as their employers might convert them from salaried to hourly employees. This might also sound as demotion. Workers may lose the chance to go the extra mile to do their jobs if their employer wants to limit their overtime pay. 

The new rule represents the Obama administration's most prominent initiative to lift middle-class wages. Millions of Americans were working long hours without fair compensation. Hence, we hope for the best!
