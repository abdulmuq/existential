Orange juice has always been considered a healthy drink and a source of much needed vitamin C. It has all the nutritional value that makes it an ideal drink for morning breakfast.

But then, why Americans have stopped consuming orange juice? 

The fact is it’s the packed orange juice that is not ideal for consuming as part of breakfast. Fresh orange juice is still quite healthy and always advisable to have it.

With the given level of sugar, packaged orange juice should be categorized as one of fizzy drinks. Packaged orange juice contains high-fructose corn syrup which is found in fizzy drinks too and have a similar effect on the body as fizzy and soft drinks in terms of sugar. Fructose found in corn syrup is a type of sugar, rich in calories.

One 12 ounce glass of orange juice contains 9 teaspoons of sugar, nearly same as a 12 ounce can of Coke. It amounts to nearly half of our daily carbohydrates intake. If a person consumes one glass of juice every day, in a year this would amount to around 70 cups of sugar or more than 50,000 extra calories.

Fructose is absorbed too fast by the body and by the time, it reaches stomach, our system doesn’t really distinguish between orange juice and coke. 

Extra unwanted calories results in various health related complications. It leads to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Research carried out by British Medical Journal in the summer found fruit juice is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and has made people realize that fruit juice may not be as wholesome as they once believed.

Behind this healthy image of packaged fruit drinks, is the business of billions of dollars. Many orange juice producers use phrases like “100% pure” and “pure squeezed” but actually manufacture a processed product.

Alissa Hamilton in her book [Squeezed: What You Don't Know about Orange Juice says](http://squeezed.yupnet.org) that producers of pasteurized orange juice used to store their juice in vast tanks. In order to keep it fresh, the juice had to be stripped of oxygen. After this, the product could be stored for up to a year. The only problem was that this process also removed much of the taste. Hence it needed flavor packs to make it taste like orange juice.

Even if you don’t want to give up juice completely, you can reduce portion size and have it with a meal so that it doesn’t get absorbed by your body too fast. However, I would it should be replaced by intact fruit. With fresh fruits and vegetables, you will get fibre, more nutrients and fewer calories.

Americans have lately understood that once considered a healthy drink is actually not so healthy. One should not worry about vitamin C deficiency at the cost high risks that packed fruit juices carry. Given the risks that so called healthy fruit drinks possess, it is time we remember “prevention is better than cure”.
