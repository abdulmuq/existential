Ways to Explain Employment Gap on Resume

#####1. Be honest

Nothing hurts and repels HRs as lies. So, be truthful and honest. Nobody would like to trust and work with a dishonest person who tries to modify facts. If the interview asks, tell if you were laid off or resigned on your own. Trust is an important part of employer-employee relationship.

#####2. Highlight new skills learnt

Time off from work is the best time to learn new skills. Enrich your resume by learning new skills. Mention what new skills you learnt during a career gap. It shows that you were connected to your profession and aren’t an outdated resource.

#####3. Mention volunteering experience

While staying away from work, think if you would like to volunteer for a good cause. Mention this experience on your resume as it is considered positive by many companies.

#####4. Work for open-source technologies

If you are a techie, you can also work for open-source technologies and contribute your bit to people who are working for the good of people. Although you may not get paid, it can certainly be counted as work experience.

#####5. Be well-prepared

Be prepared in advance on how to answer questions related to career gap. You might have taken time off to travel, raise kids or take care of ailing parents. Whatever be the reason, have an answer ready so that you don’t get nervous and fumble in the interview.

#####6. Be confident

Always be confident during an interview while discussing a career gap. Justify the reasons for which you had quit your job. While the thought of discussing how you became unemployed, especially if you were laid off, might make you uneasy, don’t panic.

#####7. Stay positive

You never know what life may throw at you. A positive attitude can make a lot of difference in your career. Try to convince the interviewer that you have the right skills that the job requires and hence you are a good fit for it.
