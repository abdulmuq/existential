Aldebaran - A French company with an Arabic name (The name Aldebaran is Arabic (الدبران al-dabarān) and means "the Follower")  named after a star in the Zodiac constellation made the most amazing humanoid robot of recent times.

The Japanese company Softbank - A giant telco of the same name in Japan and a Venture capital firm in most other parts of the world, came about and invested over $100m to acquire majority stake.

What happened was a case of a bad corporate take over with Softbank arm twisting its vision of the future of the company, essentially killing the company.

The result of this exercise is a silly robot called Pepper which looks like a bad version of Nao with an iPad in the chest, now welcoming customers at the door in about 140 stores in Japan.

Ex-employees of Aldebaran have highlighted that the culture differences between the Japanese and the French were too great leading to an exodus of top talent.  

Many point the blame at Aldebaran’s executive team (namely, CEO & Founder Bruno Maisonnier). Respected in his field, Maisonnier has been criticized as having his heads in the clouds with respect to Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI), focusing more on the possibility of humans becoming friends with robots than on the practical applications of humanoid robots.

Whatever is the truth, it is a sad that the Japanese once the most innovative in the world as far as Robotics were concerned actually were directly or indirectly responsible for the death of a shiny star - Aldebaran.
