With unprecedented rainfall in Texas, Greg Abbott, The Governor of Texas, has declared a state of disaster in 9 counties. Heavy rains have hit the infrastructure very badly leaving at least 5 dead in America’s fourth-largest city, Houston. He said that flood risks will continue to remain for several days.

A state of emergency is declared in Houston due to heavy flash floods caused by torrential rain. It is believed that more than 1,000 homes have been flooded and around 100,000 people were left without power after more than 17 inches of rain in just few hours led to severe flooding in the Houston metro area.

Several shelters were set up for people forced out of their homes. At least 1,000 people were rescued from apartment complexes in the north of the city and moved to a shopping mall. They were later being shifted to a shelter by bus.
