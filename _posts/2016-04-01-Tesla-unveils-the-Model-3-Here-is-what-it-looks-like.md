Tesla unveiled its most affordable car yet, the Model 3 sedan, with the starting price of $35,000 on Thursday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduced the prototype version of the car at their Los Angeles Space X design studio.

Anxious customers reserved over 115,000 Model 3 sedans on the day of the release. Some of the unique features include panoramic glass roof, automatic lane change, seats 5 and goes at least 215 miles on an electric charge. And while its performance wont be as breathtaking as the other higher end Tesla models, it still offers an impressive Zero to 60miles/hr. in less than 6 seconds. Car has a trunk in both the front and back, and comes standard with a huge screen on the center console although it is slightly smaller than on the Model S or X.

To support Model 3 sales, Musk says Tesla plans to double the number of stores it has worldwide to 441 by the end of next year. It also plans to double its fast-charging stations to 7,200. Superchargers are high-speed chargers, both in cities and on major highways, that allow for intercity travel. 

Experts say Tesla may offer many different versions of the Model 3, some fancier than the others that would be priced accordingly.  All in all, Model 3 is critical to Tesla’s success as its catered towards the average car buyers in the electric car market.
