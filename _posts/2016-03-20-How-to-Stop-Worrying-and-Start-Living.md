Worry is what keeps many people awake till late night and makes them feel dull and gloomy. Unrelenting anxiety and fear can be debilitating and drain you of energy — emotional and physical.

Quite often it is said that you become what you think. What you think turns into an action, an action into a habit and a habit creates you. For many people worrying has become a habit so powerful that they don’t even realize that they are worrying unnecessarily. But like any other habit and behavior, it can be changed too.

People who worry a lot can’t relax and enjoy life. They can’t focus on their goals and hence often don’t achieve their targets. Due to inability to concentrate well, they lack behind from their peers which makes them worry more. Thus, it creates a vicious cycle which a person finds difficult to come out from.

But, don’t worry. I am here to help you today. We will see methods of how to stop worrying and start enjoying life.

Don’t think about past failures. Many people keep brooding over past events and keep saying to themselves, “I wish I hadn’t done that”, “I wish it wouldn’t have happened” and so on. They forget the fact that they have a lot in their hands on. Life is not over. You can still work hard and be happy. You are the maker of your destiny. If some are unhappy with their past, other day-dream. The only way to achieve your dreams is through hard work and determination.

##### 2. Set Realistic Goals
Setting goals which are beyond your abilities is bound to bring frustration and depression. So, while deciding your goals keep your limitations in mind and see what is practically achievable. Also, while creating goals don’t compare yourself with others. You are so unique and so is your life. Think what you want to achieve in your life, it is perfectly ok if it’s different from your peers. After all, life is not a race, definitely much more than that.

##### 3. Create Roadmap
Once you are clear about your goals, create a plan of how you will achieve them. List down the resources you have with you and the ones you will need. Think over the challenges you may face and ways of overcoming them. Thus, you will be much more prepared to face tough life.

##### 4. Set Timeline
No goals can be achieved if you don’t set a timeline. However, focus on means to achieve them rather than worrying about the deadline. You will be amazed to find that it becomes quite easier when you break a bigger task into smaller ones and set timeline for each.

##### 5. Recreation Activities
Spend time with your near and dear ones. Go for hike, visit new places, play a sport, volunteer for cause, party with friends… the list goes on. Exercise regularly to keep yourself physically and mentally fit. Meditating just for 10 minutes daily will help you to be calmer and happier. It will also improve your productivity as well as feel satisfied.
Remember, nobody is perfect. Accept failure and learn from mistakes.
Hope above tips will help you manage your life better. So, don’t worry, be happy!
