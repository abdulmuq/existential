Nancy Regan was born as Anne Frances Robbins on July 6, 1921 in New York City to Kenneth Seymour Robbins, a car salesman and his actress wife Edith Prescott Luckett. Her parents separated in 1928, after which her mother traveled the country to pursue her acting career, while Nancy was raised for six years in Maryland by her aunt and uncle. In 1929, her mother married Loyal Edward Davis, a neurosurgeon and moved to Chicago.

Nancy attended Smith College in Massachusetts, where she majored in theater. She was an actress when she met Ronald Reagan in the early 1950s, then an actor and president of the Screen Actors Guild. Their marriage lasted 52 years, until Ronald Reagan's death in 2004.

In 1967, Nancy was appointed by Ronald who was Governor of California from 1967 to 1975, to the California Arts Commission and later was named Los Angeles Times' Woman of the Year.

As First Lady of California, Nancy visited veterans, the elderly, and the handicapped, and worked with a number of charities. She became involved with the Foster Grandparents Program to help it to popularize in the United States and Australia.

When Reagan’s second term as Governor of California ended in 1975, he wanted to fight presidency in 1976. However, Nancy was reluctant and feared for his health and career, though she believed that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved.

Though her husband lost the 1976 Republican nomination, Reagan ran again for the presidency in 1980 and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. Throughout the campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role and was quite influential on her husband’s personal as well as professional decisions.

Nancy had keen interest in fashion and glamour industry. Her wardrobe consisted of dresses, gowns, and suits made by luxury designers, for which she later faced severe criticism from the media.

On March 1930 1981, President Reagan was shot by his unofficial protector who had attempted to assassinate him. After that incident, Nancy stated in her memoirs, "I felt panicky every time [Ronald] left the White House" and made sure to know her husband's schedule.

President Reagan had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, after which she became his primary caregiver and became actively involved with the National Alzheimer's Association.

Nancy Reagan was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President George W. Bush on July 9, 2002.
