Recently, Mars has made a precautionary decision to voluntarily recall a batch of Snickers, Mars, Milky Way and Celebrations products produced in Netherlands factory, after a small piece of red plastic was found in one Snickers bar purchased by a customer in Germany.
The recall of the chocolate snacks hit most European countries, but it also extended as far as Vietnam and Sri Lanka in Asia.

Eline Bijveld, Mars corporate affairs coordinator for the Netherlands, told press,” The recall only involves the products that are made in the Netherlands at the Mars factory in the southern town of Veghel, adding the products were mainly sold in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe.”

In the history of Veghel factory that opened in 1963 and employs around 1,200 people, this was the first time that the company had to recall its products.

Though chocolate manufacturer giant Mars couldn’t give the exact number of chocolate products produced daily at the factory, but said approximately four million bars were being recalled in the Netherlands alone.

A recall was announced after a customer found a piece of red plastic in a Snickers bar bought on January 8 in Germany. After he complained to Mars, the plastic piece was traced back to Veghel. It was later found that the plastic came from a protective cover used in the factory’s manufacturing process.

"We are currently investigating exactly what's happened, but we cannot be sure that this red piece of plastic isn't in any other of our products from the same production line," Bijveld said.

Mars in Germany confirmed that it was one of the countries affected, and said in a statement that the recall affected products with best before dates from 19 June 2016 to 8 January 2017. The recall concerns only specific products that were manufactured at the Netherlands facility during a limited production period, December 5, 2015 - January 18, 2016.

While preventing its customers to consume chocolate bars mentioned earlier, Mars added that the recall was an "isolated incident and strictly limited, and concerns only the products mentioned".

The products manufactured at Netherlands factory are also shipped to other countries, including some duty free retailers. To this, Mars has announced that only certain products labeled on pack as “Mars Netherlands” are affected by this recall. So in order to determine that whether the product some from affected lot, consumers can look for “Mars Netherlands” label.

Business analyst believe that the recall of batch of chocolates will have significant financial cost attached, about millions of dollars. Not only sales are lost, but it will also have an impact on medium to long-term demand forecast. People will be more hesitant to buy the Mars products while this remains fresh in their memories. But as Mars has acted swiftly and comprehensively, it has likely limited long-term damage.

As the recall affects mostly European and some of the Asian countries, chocolate lovers in United States need not worry and can keep on gulping them!
