Every now and then, we hear of storm, drought, flood or heavy snowfall in some part of the planet we inhabit. Gone are the days when seasonal changes used to happen on time.

*Have you ever wondered what there are heavy rains in some parts of the country whereas there is acute shortage of water in some other areas?*

*What disturbs the natural cycle of climate change?*

The reason is : **Global Warming.**

It is as if Earth is suffering from disease called global warming which if not cured on time, can destroy human existence.
So, what are the symptoms, causes and remedies of this disease?

####Symptoms

Global climate change has already started showing effects on environment. Shrinking of glaciers, ice on river, changing habitat areas among animals, some birds’ species close to extinction and trees flowering are only some of them.
Scientists had developed theories that would analyze the effects of global warming on climate change. Those effects – melting of ice in arctic region, accelerated rise in sea level, intense heat waves - are actually occurring now, proving these theories true.

####Causes

According to NASA, Earth’s temperature has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit during 20th century. This sounds small change, but when compared to Earth’s history the global average temperature has stable over long periods of time. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. 
The IPCC states, “Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time."

This rise in temperature is largely due to rise in greenhouse gases produced by human activities. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are primary greenhouse gases along with Chloroflorocarbons (CFCs). These gases trap the heat radiated by Earth’s surface towards space and act as warm blanket around Earth.
Over past century due to industrial revolution and modern transportation, burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

####Remedies
Resuming to climatic conditions prior to modern era will surely take time and herculean efforts because the impact is huge. Some of small changes that we can bring out in our lifestyle has huge potential to bring about positive changes in climate.

##### 1.Grow more trees
Trees consume carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. Also, we must reduce deforestation so that wildlife and birds get their natural habitat. Trees also help in holding soil strong, thus preventing soil erosion in case of heavy floods.

##### 2.Reduce- Recycle-Reuse
Many plastic products are non-biodegradable and hence cannot be recycle. Hence use of biodegradable products like paper and cloth should be encouraged.

##### 3.Go Green 
Increased use of renewable sources of energy like wind, bio-gas, hydro and solar energy. Government must step forward and encourage innovative products that promote these energy resources.

##### 4.Reduce usage of electricity
In many countries, electricity is still produced from traditional sources like coal which create huge amount greenhouse gases. Hence, we must strive to live a simple life and use electrical appliances only as required.

##### 5.Shared Transportation
Measures must be taken to promote carpooling and shared public transportation like buses and trains and cite their benefits to people.

####Closing thoughts

Global warming is definitely much more than written here, but all living beings on earth including plants are experiencing this shift in climate.
I, you and everybody must come together and act now. Together, we can bring about change in climate and leave it as it should be for our future generations.
