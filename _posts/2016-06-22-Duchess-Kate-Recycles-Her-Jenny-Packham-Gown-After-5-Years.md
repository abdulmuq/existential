In what is considered to be a shocking incident amongst the media and celebrities, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton on Wednesday, June 22, was found at  London’s EACH (East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices) gala dinner, wearing the same Jenny Packham gown that she wore nearly five years ago.

Now, that’s really shocking considering the lifestyle of the royal family of England!

Duchess Kate, 34, and her husband, Prince William, who looked handsome in his traditional tux and dickie bow, were attending an event that benefits the Nook Appeal, a fund to build a new hospice in Norfolk, England. Middleton dazzled in a pale pink gown embellished with rose sequins and Swarovski crystals, which suited her English rose complexion while she looked elegant and a perfect princess. She accessorized with diamond drop earrings gifted to her by the Queen, pale pink L.K. Bennett Agata bow sandals and a rose-colored silk Prada clutch, with a sparkling diamond bracelet. 

Duchess Kate first debuted the blush pink dress in June 2011 during an ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) gala dinner at Kensington Palace, which was her first royal appearance post nuptials. 

In spite of the dress being more than five year old and she being a mother of two children, the dress fitted her so well. The only difference was that instead of letting her locks hang loose as before, she wore her hair up in a lady-like chignon.

But, perhaps she liked the dress too much and so considered the dress appropriate to be worn for the second time at the gala dinner at England's Houghton Hall. She was present at the dinner to support East Anglia's Children's Hospices as they raised money for a new hospice. Duchess Kate has been a supporter of the healthcare nonprofit since 2012.

A special five course meal was created and cooked by Michelin star chefs - Galton Blackiston, Sat Bains, Claude Bosi, Tom Kerridge and Mark Edwards.

Kate suggested her husband was looking forward to a break from her cooking at the event as she said, “William has to put up with my cooking most of the time.”

Responding to his wife's wit William said, “It's the reason I'm so skinny.”

What do we have to say about the Royal Duchess recycling her dress?

Well, it doesn’t matter as long as she keeps looking gorgeous as always.
