It was usual Wednesday morning, but one incident ended life of two people on UCLA campus. It was then no longer usual day.

A mechanical engineering professor was shot in a campus building by a student who was believed to be upset about his grades. The student then killed self too.

Many heavily armed officers thronged the extensive Westwood campus, while thousands of students and staff secured themselves in classrooms and offices. The shooting incident took place shortly around 10 a.m. local time and nearly two hours later, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck declared the threat over.

The victim was identified as William S. Klug, 39, a father of two who studied the interaction between mechanics and biology. Klug, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, was believed to be brilliant and kind. His past students considered him an exceptional mentor. His colleague, Alan Garfinkel, a professor of integrative biology and physiology said, “I am absolutely devastated. You cannot ask for a nicer, gentler, sweeter and more supportive guy than William Klug.” Another UCLA Professor Charles Knobler said that those who knew Klug are in shock.

The initial report of the shooting prompted the university to send Bruin Alerts to all students and staff notifying them to avoid the area and secure themselves. Students hid in buildings across campus. They were asked to put off their laptops, turned out lights and switched off the projector. They were ordered to be quiet and get under their desks. 

As part of UCLA protocol, students were asked not to use their phones. However, some of them were in touch with their reporters through texts and social media. They struggled to lock the doors of the classrooms where they sought shelter but would not lock and were forced to use their belts and furniture to barricade themselves against any potential threat.

With rumors spreading like wild fire, it was initially believed that there were multiple shooters on the campus. Later, it was revealed that the shooter was amongst the two dead men. The students were asked to exit buildings with their hands up. The classes were cancelled on Wednesday, but were expected to resume by Thursday.

With gun violence incidents occurring across U.S. every now and then, it leaves below questions open – 
Does U.S. need stricter gun occupation rules?

Does Obama administration need to work on strategies dealing with gun violence?
