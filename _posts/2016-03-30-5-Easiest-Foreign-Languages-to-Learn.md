Considering that English has become the lingua franca of the 21st century, people having English as their native language, regardless of their nationality, generally find it to communicate with foreigners.
However, you may want to learn foreign language if you are looking forward to study or travel in a foreign country, or it could be just for fun. Language skills are also crucial for professionals. Learning a second language proficiently can lead to new careers. 
Let’s take a look at which are the easiest second languages to learn for English speakers.
Easiest foreign languages to learn for English speakers


#####1. French
French is one of the easiest Latin-derived languages for English native speakers to learn. Up to one-third of today’s English has been influenced by French. French is the most-spoken language in the world after English which makes quite a good reason to learn French. Many of the English words are similar to French words. These words might differ slightly in their spelling and hence it becomes easier for English speaking people to read and understand them. However when it comes to writing them, people may find it a little difficult in the beginning.

#####2. Spanish
Spanish community is one of the largest immigrant community in the United States which increase the chances of its usability. In Spanish, words are pronounced as they are written. However, depending on the country, there are different pronunciation and dialects. Spanish in Argentina is different from that in Spain.

#####3. Italian
Italian is also more or less like English. The pronunciation and spelling of words, grammar rules, syntax and vocabulary of Italian match with English to a great extent. In fact, Italian is so easy that even if you don’t learn this language, you can manage to carry on a conversation, though in broken way.

#####4. Swedish
English and Swedish share many cognates, especially in spoken language. Swedish has a similar syntax and vocabulary to English, which makes it quite easy to learn. Also, Swedish word order structure and verb conjugations follow similar grammatical rules as those of English.

#####5. Afrikaans
Like English, Afrikaans belongs to the West Germanic language family. Unlike English, there is no verb conjugation (drink, drank, drunk). It is logical and shares many Germanic-derived root words that are familiar to English speakers.
There’s no way of getting more fully immersed in cultural exuberance than by learning the language and exploring it from within. If you’re interested in learning a second language, it’s certainly worth starting with some of the easier ones to see how you like it. Be sure to consider what advantages learning a specific language will have for you.
