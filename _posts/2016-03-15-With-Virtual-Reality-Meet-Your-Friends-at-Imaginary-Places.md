With virtual reality headsets, you can enjoy some crazy experiences like gunning down your opponents in Call of Duty or enjoying an episode of House of Cards.
However, next to full body sensor suits, one of the most important experiences missing from virtual reality is the capability to share the VR experiences with others.

vTime, a mobile app lets you bridge the geographic gaps between users by giving them full VR enabled avatars that can interact with each other in virtual environments at real time. 
vTime helps you connect with friends and family around the world by using a phone, console or computer, a mobile VR headset and an internet connection.

From the above demonstration video, which looks quite impressive, vTime can turn out to be a great app for virtual meetings. Though these are quite early days, it looks really promising to be able to date a girl in some beautiful location in Paris or visit your parents from the comfort of your dorm room.

The best way to use vTime is through one of the official vTime supported VR devices like Samsung Gear or Google Cardboard but you also use it with your smartphone, given that it’s either a Nexus, Samsung, LG or HTC phone. 

Initially, you'll be able to vTime with up to three friends in one session. Through early access release, we'll be looking for community feedback to influence whether that number needs to increase.

**BigScreen** - another VR app developed by Y Combinator alumni and CEO Darshan Shankar along with co-founder Hayden Lee, lets you use your entire desktop, with anyone, in virtual reality.

Shankar said, “Anything that you can do on your computer - browsing the Web, watching videos, playing video games, and even productive work - you can do in VR on massive screens with BigScreen. You can play games in a virtual reality LAN party, watch movies with your buddies, collaborate together, or simply hangout. Four people can join in a virtual party and can see what the other user is doing on their screen”. BigScreen supports Oculus Rift and HTC Vive and mobile VR devices like Samsung VR.
