Breakfast has been considered the most important meal of the day, and it is important to consume a healthy, nutrients-packed breakfast in order to start your day off right. A nutritionally-rich breakfast consisting of protein and fiber will give you the necessary energy to get through the morning and keep you going until lunch. However, a breakfast loaded with sugar and fat will leave you with a mid-morning energy crash and make you feel dull before lunch.

Most people rely on packaged cereals to start their day. One of the most common breakfast cereal is corn flakes. But did you know that 7 of the 12 tested corn flakes brands had 2 or more teaspoons of sugar per 100g? Can it be considered as a healthy start of a day?

Now, let’s have a look at how you can substitute corn flakes with healthier breakfast options
Healthier Breakfast Substitutes of Corn Flakes

#####1. Yogurt cup

Low-fat plain yogurt is a great way to get some protein and calcium in the morning, but avoid fruity varieties as they may have more than 10 grams of sugar. Instead of a flavored cup of yogurt, try a protein-packed smoothie or plain yogurt mixed with nuts and dried fruit.

#####2. Granola

Instead of having readymade granola laden with sugar, prepare it at home. Add whole grains like oats, quinoa or bran for fiber, nuts for healthy fats and coconut and dried fruits for a bit of sweetness and plenty of flavor.

#####3. Shredded wheat

Shredded wheat contains more calories per cup as compared to corn flakes, but has no added sugar or sodium, and contains more fiber, protein and whole grains. It will keep you fuller longer, and so you will be less likely to dive into snacks or higher-calorie lunch options.

#####4. Porridge

Porridge is rich in minerals and has high fibre content that keeps blood sugar under control. Use a little jaggery if you wish to sweeten it, or top it with fresh fruits, raisins and almonds.

#####5. Gluten Free Organic Cereal

Go for gluten free organic cereals like [Nature’s Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Flakes](http://us.naturespath.com/product/mesa-sunriser-flakes) which uses corn meal or yellow corn flour from non genetically modified organisms (GMO) corn. It also contains a number of other grains: buckwheat, flax, quinoa, and amaranth. The flax seeds in it provide a source of ALA omega-3. This cereal contains 3g of fiber per 3/4 cup serving.

Doctors have always debated on the permissible level of sugar in breakfast cereals, especially of the colored and sugar-frosted varieties. One can make breakfast healthier by having all cereals with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk and avoiding extra sugar, but if you still like a bit of sweetness in your breakfast replace white sugar with fruits like banana, dates, raisins, or any dry fruits.
