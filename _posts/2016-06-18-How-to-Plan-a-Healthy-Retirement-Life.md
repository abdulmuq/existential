Retirement is a time when you are done with all the responsibilities of your life and wish to spend the rest of the time enjoying the greater good that life has to offer. It is the time to be happy and reap the fruits of all the hard work done throughout life. Also, post-retirement, it is a time to set your own schedule, take long vacations and start spending all the money you had been saving.

However, you can sit and relax in your retirement life only when you enjoy good health with all the finances planned well earlier. The lifestyle choices in present affect your chances of a healthy retirement. According to data from the federal government, older Americans use more health care than any other age group. Hence, planning for health care in retirement is so important.

Chronic physical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and asthma can start draining bank accounts as well as our physical and mental well-being. So, what things you should keep in mind while planning a healthy retirement life?

#####1. Plan a steady source of income
There is a high probability that you will not be able to work post retirement. Hence you must have a steady income to support your needs and lifestyle. Make the right investments now so that you don’t have to worry later. It is believed that retirees enjoy more with money earned from pension or rental properties than that from 401(k).

#####2. Live a healthy lifestyle now
A vast number of Americans suffer from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer which are primarily related to wrong lifestyle and unhealthy diet. Eating well and exercising regularly are the two most important ways you can save yourself from chronic diseases. Regular blood tests each year can help spot small problems like slightly high cholesterol, blood sugar or blood pressure quite early, before they become full-blown conditions.

#####3. Estimate health expense
Many-a-times, people overestimate how much Medicare offered through private insurers can cover health related expenses. What they miss to calculate is the need to pay premiums, co-pays and long-term care costs. Hence, you must save enough in younger years so that you don’t remain devoid of latest medical health care. 

#####4. Decide if you will work after retirement
Now, this sounds quite like an oxymoron.
I mean, who will call it a retirement, if you still keep working?
The idea is to work on your hobbies or do a part-time job. The benefit of working isn’t just financial. It’s also works wonders for your health—a key driver of retirement happiness. The physical activity and social connections that a job provides are a good antidote to an unhealthy, inactive and lonely lifestyle.
However, if you're going to follow the work-longer strategy, you must take care of your health now and be ready to face competition from younger lot.

#####5. Stay close to your children
Staying at an arm’s length from your children can make you happy as you or them can visit each other often and celebrate festivals together.

A well thought strategy to save and invest money will give you financial independence in long term so that you can enjoy life to the fullest.
