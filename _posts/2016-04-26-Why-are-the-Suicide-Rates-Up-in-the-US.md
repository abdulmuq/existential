We are at a strange point amidst all the progress we are making in the field of technology, healthcare and space science, to name a few, but day by day our lives are becoming more stressed than ever before. In spite of all the achievements, many people still feel unfulfilled and unhappy with their lives.

This is the reason many men and women in U.S. are committing suicides. It remains one of the top 10 causes of death for Americans. No matter how successful or unsuccessful they are, they are at a verge of mental and emotional breakdown. The only way out, they see, is to end their lives.

According to a new report by National Center for Health Statistics, the suicide rate in the United States has increased by 24% from 1999 through 2014. This hike in suicide rate is not limited to any particular age group or gender.

#####Reasons behind Increase in Suicides in U.S.

While there can be number of social, economic and health reasons behind suicidal tendency, it is believed that the inability to cope up with adverse circumstances is the primary reason. 

Below are some of the psychiatric factors that result in suicides:

1. Depression

2. Bipolar Disorder

3. Schizophrenia

4. Feeling burnt-out

Apart from poor mental health, there could be stress due to financial reasons too. Studies showed 1% annual increase in suicides in the period 1999 – 2006, but 2% yearly hike post that, as the economy depreciated, unemployment rose steeply and millions lost their homes.
Drug addiction, troubled relationship, social isolation and peer pressure rising due to social media are also believed to be the reasons behind the rise in suicides in U.S.

#####Age, Gender and Suicide

For women, the highest percent increase in suicide rates was among those aged 10–14, while for men it was 45–64.

The research report says that the increase in suicide rate was higher among women - 45% increase - than males - 16% increase. But as of 2014, the suicide rate in males is still three times higher than in females.

Females actually commit suicide more frequently than males, but males die by suicide more often. Males are choosing more lethal methods of committing suicide than women. Use of guns was the most used method by males, whereas females used poison most of the times to kill themselves.

Overall, there is an alarming increase of 89% in suffocation method (hanging self), after adjusting for growth in population and decrease in usage of firearms and pills. Also, suicide is one of the prime reasons for increasing mortality amongst white men and women aged 45-54.

#####Prevention of Suicide

We believe that if the patients are given enough counselling and medication, if required, suicide can be prevented. Their families, friends and relatives must also come together and create a positive, happy and cheerful environment. In case someone wants to keep it private, he or she can call National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
