Singaporean actress, Oon Shu An’s, four and a half minutes video on exploration of cultural and personal identity, both in different countries and at home went viral on web. Last year, her five-minute vlog (video blog) on the [price of beauty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJGM1tO3dY) had gone viral.

The video, written by local playwright, Joel Tan, and conceptualized by Oon, shows the actress having a passionate monologue about identity as scenes of places from different countries are projected on her and the backdrop.

Oon begins the video by talking about how foreigners view Singapore as "the gateway to the world" and her desire to escape the overwhelming crowds for greener pastures. She then travels to countries like the U.S., China, Thailand and India, and correctly highlights the stereotypical views people hold about others in these countries. She also covers how differently she identified with herself in each new place and contrasted them with the wide spectrum of opinions people had of her.

On [Oon’s facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/oonshuan/videos/914923148631123/), she mentions, “Who we think we are could be completely different from who other people think we are. And where we are, definitely affects that too.” 

Referring to the U.S. as "TV land," Oon says, "But here I am the Asian girl who speaks great English; who must be good at math."

Recalling her experience in China, she says, "I'm reminded that for them I'm the girl whose family escape a history of suffering. I could barely speak to find my way, let alone call this my motherland."

She proceeds to explain her perceptions about Thailand and India as well as how she is perceived by the people there.

In the end of the video, Oon travels back to her home, Singapore, and then ends her monologue with a profound declaration and question she poses to us, "We are all foreign. So what decides who should stay or who should go?"

She rightly leaves the question open and provides food for thought.

Since she has uploaded the video on Facebook on Wednesday night, it has been widely accepted by her fans all over the world.
At the time of writing, Oon's video has gone viral with close to 287,000 views, 6,332 shares and 6,200 likes on Facebook. 

That’s clearly a huge hit on the internet!

On being asked about the success of her video, she says, "The positive reactions are a relief. We are really happy It's always nerve wrecking putting out a video because you never know how people are going to react to it."
