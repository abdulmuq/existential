![Existential - Our love will blossom in another World, in another Season](/img/Our-love-will-blossom-in-another-World-in-another-Season.jpg)

*It was love at first sight,* 

*When I held your hand, when I kissed your feet, when I touched your lips,*

*Indeed, it was love at first sight,*

*As I had waited for this unification, in utter anticipation as my heart skips.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*How well I remember the tears down my cheeks, as I heard your voice for once,* 

*For all my life, in your absence, was I not a dunce?*

*As our hands touch, didn’t you feel the warmth of a subtle wreathing?*

*I felt complete in your arms, your chest against mine, feeling the rhythm of our synchronized breathing.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Your touch, your smile, your ever so clumsy being –*

*You made me fall in love with you, as I immerse myself in your spellbound seeing.*

*How much I had loved spending my days, just in your observance,*

*For I did not need much to celebrate, than delight myself with your fervence.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*The days are long, the nights even longer,*

*For you are not next to me, in my arms, yet our love grows stronger.*

*You re-define love and loss in my life with utter grief,*

*As our togetherness was intense, fulfilling but unjustly brief.*

*But to the world, my love and hurt cannot be showing,*

*Not a day has passed by that I didn’t carry your remembrance in my aimless going …*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*My son, please know it was not abandonment, just destiny,*

*Our distance has left mommy lost, broken and in agony.*

*It has been exactly two years today –*

*From the day I left you behind, with anguish and in tears,*

*But now is the time, we let go of our fears.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*If it’s meant to happen, it will, against all force,*

*May be time will show the truth that mommy was indeed in remorse.*

*Don’t fear, oh dear, the time is near,*

*You will indeed see the love, as the distance between is very sheer.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Today, I let go of you my dear,*

*I shall not grieve, nor shed a tear,*

*Promise me, you shall not fear,*

*As the darkness of our fate will forever tear,*

*Just in time, with much patience and love, for us to cheer.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*My son, please know it was not abandonment, just destiny,*

*Our distance has left mommy lost, broken and in agony.*

*But to the world, my love and hurt cannot be showing,*

*Not a day has passed by that I didn’t carry your remembrance in my aimless going …*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*For now, I will prepare of our imminent unification, with much anticipation,*

*Easing off the pain, so my heart beats without a reason, *

*Our togetherness was short, but warm*

*May our love blossom in another world, in another season...*
