Many people consider vegetable oil as one of the healthiest options. 

According to the American Heart Association, using olive oil, enables one to cook healthier foods, and the main issue is that butter should be avoided at all costs since it is high in saturated fats. On the other hand, vegetable oils can help to lower cholesterol since they contain linoleic acid, which is a type of polyunsaturated fat. The common belief is that as a result, cardiovascular problems are reduced.

Unfortunately it seems that this is not quite true. According to Christopher Ramsden, a medical investigator at the US National Institutes of Health, the Minnesota Coronary experiment reveals the contrary results. This study was conducted between 1968 and 1973. Ramsden became interested in the results of this experiment and contacted Robert Frantz, the son of the lead author of this experiment, Ivan Frantz. The experiment was carried out on people who had their saturated fat traded for vegetable oil. This study concluded that according to the results there were practically no differences between the different groups that were used in the study, nether in cardiovascular events nor deaths. Despite the fact that the people on whom the experiment was conducted noted a reduction in their cholesterol levels, at the end of the day this could not be directly associated with a lower mortality rate from cardiovascular problems. A similar study was once more carried out in 2013, and the same results emerged.

It would be interesting to give some thought as to how this conclusion might effect, or could have affected, nutritionist and dietary control over the years. The bottom line is that probably the best thing would be to conduct additional research so as to establish the truth in this regard.
