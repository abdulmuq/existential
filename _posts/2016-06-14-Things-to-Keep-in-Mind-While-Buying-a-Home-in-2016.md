#####Credit Score

Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to get a complimentary credit report from three of the largest credit reporting bureaus. Look at your TransUnion credit report at My.CreditCards.com for free. Generally, the better your credit, the lower the interest rate you'll have to pay. Make sure your score is above 650 so that you create a good impression on lenders. It is important to have more than one line of credit, but be careful not to owe so much that it looks like you’ll struggle to pay your monthly house note.

#####Budget

Once you are sure that you have a good credit score, plan your budget. Make sure you consider all the liabilities on you while you finalize budget for your home. Figure out your lifestyle needs and monthly expenses as well as what you are looking for in a property.

#####Real Estate Agent

An agent can help you through the process of buying home. Many a times, you might not be aware of properties at sale and their owners. This is where an agent comes in to introduce you both and agree on amount that is mutually acceptable. You need someone who knows about the current market rates and trends, and is responsive to your queries in the way you find most comfortable, be it email or face to face meetings.

#####Control Expenses

If your monthly credit card debt is more than 30% of your limit, lenders might see it as a potential risk. Hence, pay your credit card expenses as soon as you can or better, keep check on them for a while.

#####Pre-qualification

Determining in advance how much of a loan a lender will give you isn't necessary, but it will help you if yours is one of several bids of same property. Check out online tools of bank you do business with. Banks will get back to you once they know your income and how much you will be able to pay.

#####Consider FHA

If you are unable to pay heavy down payment, then Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured-mortgages can help you with just 3.5% down, but for that your credit score must be at least 580. For a score between 500 and 580, you need to pay 10% down payment. Below 500, you are unlikely to get the loan. Keep in mind that monthly premiums for the FHA insurance will last for the life of loan. You can possibly buy a home at cheaper rates, but you will carry that extra tab until you've paid off the loan in full.

Buying home for the first time at a young age can be complex and challenging if you don’t plan your finances well. Hope above tips will help you buy your first home smoothly.
