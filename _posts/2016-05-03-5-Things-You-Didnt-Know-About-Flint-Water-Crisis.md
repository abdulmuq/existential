Do you think you know everything about flint water crisis if you have been following news lately?

May be not.

There are few facts that aren’t published and much talked about. First let’s have a look at what probably you would have heard about Flint water crisis.

The Flint water crisis is a drinking water contamination issue in Flint, Michigan, United States that started in April 2014. After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River (to which officials had failed to apply corrosion inhibitors), its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger. The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal.

Children, in Flint, were exposed to such contaminated drinking water, due to which they might have suffered from number of ailments. According to an estimate, the percentage of lead in blood of children might have doubled from year 2013 to 2015. The polluted water has already killed 10 people and leaving 77 others affected.

2. The water from Flint River could have been checked from lead contamination through pipes for a small amount of money. However, the State authorities knowingly avoided it to cut cost.

3. Large number of people have been affected with Legionnaires Disease which implies that there might many other toxins present in water apart from lead.
