Building a high credit score can be quite a process, especially if your current score is south of 700, however good financial behaviors will be well worth it when the price you’ll pay to borrow drops. But it would need continued serious efforts on your part until you begin to see the improvement in your three-digit number. 

Let me tell you exactly what to do: 

1. Request a copy of your credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com. The three major credit bureaus Experian, TransUnion and Equifax should give you one free copy every year, so request one every four moths so you are aware of your most current score.

2. Check each of your credit reports for errors or discrepancies and dispute, if necessary. Getting errors corrected on your credit report could give the fastest boost to your score. If you see any unpaid debt on your report that you have already paid off contact the lender requesting to update your file. All three credit bureaus also have dispute forms on their website for their customers.

3. Make 100% of your payments on time, inclusive of all credit cards, student loans, car loans, utility or medical bills etc. Unpaid bills could be sold to collection agencies that could seriously jeopardize your credit. Your payment history makes 35% of your FICO credit score, so take it extremely seriously.

4. Set automatic payments to pay off your debts on time, at least for the minimum monthly payment required. Or if you prefer to pay by yourself, set a bill payment reminder either through your bank or on your phone.

5. Maintain a low credit card debt, not exceeding 30% of available credit. If you have a $15,000 line of credit available, it does not mean you should use anywhere close to it. Keep your utilization ration to single digit, preferably to the 7% mark, but not exceeding 30%.

6. Establish credit history over time, by opening line of credits and paying them off responsibly. Part of your credit score is based on average account age; so don’t open too many new accounts at once.

7. Length of payment history and credit utilization is also an important factor impacting your credit score; so don’t close any old bank accounts or credit cards until they have an associated annual fee. Rather, try to keep them active, if possible.
