![Existential - The problem with over-simplification.](/img/The-Problem-with-oversimplification.jpg)

Sometimes we want to make quick decisions and because of this we tend to dumb down an issue, over simplify it or not worry about the details.

This might (unfortunately) lead us to bad outcomes. 

Let me explain why:

#####1. Oversimplification leads to solving the wrong problems or to focus on wrong goals.

If you were a car sales agent and if your manager says just go make your customers happy. Sure, if you were to sell a $20k car for $5k everyone in town will be your customer (and happy). But that is not good business and you’re not really solving the problem of increasing real sales for your business.

#####2. “Dumbing down” leads to assuming outcomes that are never possible

A simplified view of the business problem is always good. But it is not, when you don’t care or don’t understand the details.

In that process, you’re probably agreeing to something because like the stated problem, the solution is also over simplified. And because no one paid attention to the details, we assume its easier and we figure out shortcuts to get there.

#####3. Oversimplification leads to short sightedness on Vision.

#####4. Simplification leads lack of building a foundation for the long term 
— Over simplification leads to organizations wanting to take every thing possible to get stuff done (in the short term) to meet the simplified outcome that leads them to not to build the necessary long term foundation that is actually good for business.

#####5. Eventually, real problems don't get solved. 

A product like iPhone requires tremendous amount of effort between disparate systems and teams — hardware, logistics, cloud software, supply chain, retail.

Everyone wants an iPhone that just works

But, when building such a product, it is important to correctly define the problem. It is important to understand the complexity of the same and move forward keeping the complexity in mind. 

In the pursuit of such simple, flawless products, it is important that the problem and the solution not be oversimplified.
