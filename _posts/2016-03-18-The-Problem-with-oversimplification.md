![Existential - The problem with over-simplification.](/img/The-Problem-with-oversimplification.jpg)

A famous quote attributed to Albert Einstein states, *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."*

Sometimes we want to make quick decisions and because of this we tend to dumb down an issue, over simplify it or overlook important details. Unfortunately, this may lead to unfavorable outcomes. 

Let me explain why:

#####1. Oversimplification leads to solving the wrong problems or to focus on wrong goals.

In real world situations, it is crucial to acknowledge tasks with complexities and set a viable plan to deal with its intersecting causes. Inaccurate assumptions oversimplify an analysis resulting in easier but wrong conclusions.
For example, if you were a car sales agent and if your manager says just go make your customers happy. Sure, if you were to sell a $20k car for $5k, everyone in town will be your happy customer. However, this is not a wise business plan and you are failing to solve the real problem of increasing sales and profits.

#####2. “Dumbing down” leads to assuming outcomes that are never possible.

A simplified view of the business problem is always preferable. However, this approach to problem solving fails when you don’t care or understand the underlying details.
As a result, you may commit to an oversimplified view of the problem leading to an inaccurate and inefficient course of action. And because no one paid attention to details early on, we assume it’s easier to achieve the end results, and we figure out shortcuts to get there.

#####3. Oversimplification leads to short sightedness on Vision.

Oversimplification of the core problem often results in easy answers that have great appeal, but are far from the best option. Such short sightedness of vision often causes us to associate our problem(s) to “one” reason. This can lead to digging ourselves into a deeper hole since we disregard all other important contributing factors to the core problem. 


#####4. Simplification leads to lack of building a foundation for the long term.

Over simplification leads to organizations wanting to pursue everything possible to get stuff done (in the short term). This strategy works to meet the simplified short-term outcome, but distorts the focus from building the necessary long-term foundation that is crucial for a sustainable business.

#####5. Eventually, real problems stay un-resolved. 

Since complexities are difficult to understand and even more difficult to change; the unfortunate result is that we simplify things to the extent of inefficiency. On the contrary, we need to question our knowledge, evaluate our core assumptions, and separate facts from opinions. 

A product like iPhone requires tremendous amount of synchronized effort between disparate systems and teams — hardware, logistics, cloud software, supply chain, manufacturing, retail etc. While building such a product with perfection, it is important to accurately define the problem, understand the complexity of underlying tasks and move forward to create an appropriate plan. 
Thus for the pursuit of such complex but flawless products, it is important that the problem and its solution not be oversimplified.
