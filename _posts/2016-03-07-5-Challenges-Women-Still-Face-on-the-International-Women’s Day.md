Hmmm…so why do we need to celebrate women’s day? Of course, there must be some reason we celebrate women’s day.

Why is men’s day not celebrated? What is that special need to celebrate only women’s day?

The fact that women’s day is celebrated internationally compels us to think over the necessity to mark a day as women’s day.

The reason we need to celebrate women’s day points to necessity that we need to create more awareness about issues related to women. This day is meant to celebrate the spirit of womanhood even while we ponder over the plight of women in various countries. Let’s take a sneak peek on why women’s day should be celebrated and various challenges that they have to fight day in and day out in many nations.

####Challenges women face in various developed as well as developing countries

#####1. Gender pay gap

In United States, women earn approx. 21% less than their male counterparts. This wage gap increases with time, varies by location and is worse for women of color. To tackle this problem, women should learn strategies to better negotiate their pay. Businesses should conduct a survey and weed out gender based pay differences which will also result in better job satisfaction amongst women and lead to more productivity. Policy makers should make sure that The Equal Pay act is followed by the employers.

#####2. Education 

Many girls are deprived of primary education, especially in developing countries. In United States, women have outnumbered men in enrolling and completing at least bachelor’s degrees, according to [Pew study](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/01/14/chapter-1-women-in-leadership/).

#####3. Work-life balance

There is always a debate going around on whether women can actually have-it-all. Web is always flooded with how to strike a perfect work-life balance (which I believe, doesn’t exist!). Working women undergo so much of stress while juggling career and family. To add to it, men, at work, consider women as inferior to them, while at home women bear the brunt of most household chores. 

#####4. Crime against women

In many parts of Asian countries, the crime against women in particular has increased. It reflects the diminishing respect for women, in general, and the misuse of physical strength and power that men enjoy.

#####5. Leadership roles

The lack of gender equality extends in leadership roles as well. In January 2015, Pew counted 5.2 % women as CEOs in Fortune 500 companies and 17% on company boards according to 2013 data.

*Few thoughts expressed above may not be enough to describe the various hardships that women face in their day-to-day life.*

It is said that ‘Behind every successful man, there is a woman’. Women, if given equal rights in all fields of life, can achieve great heights. 

Women have made exemplary progress in technology, business, philanthropy, education, medicine, space science or politics - Angela Markel, Melinda Gates, Janet Yellen, Mallala Yousoufzai – to name a few. Check out Forbes list of [The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women](http://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/).

Many former Presidents of United States have cited the importance of moral support they received from their better halves. First Ladies like [Nancy Raegan](http://existential.us/trending/politics/2016/03/06/Nancy-Regen-former-first-lady-passed-away.html), Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama have always been source of strengths for their husbands.

Social injustice exists not just in developing countries, but in developed nations too. It’s time men and women work together to end prejudices against women and give them equal opportunities to leverage their potential to maximum extent.

Once again, **Happy Women’s Day!!** Let’s understand the true meaning of celebrating this day and value contribution of all women in our society.
