With the arrival of chatbots, speculations are on that they will mark the end of ever-increasing number of apps. For those who are unaware of what chatbots are – they are the artificial intelligent beings who can talk to you through chat, like a personal assistant who can text you. 

Interaction with chatbots is like typing a search into Google, but you can go beyond asking questions. They can book restaurants or flights, make appointments, send emails or order takeaway for you. All you need to do is drop it a message in an app like Facebook Messenger or Skype. They are designed to simulate human conversation, like a more intelligent version of Clippy or Siri.

#####Why Chatbots are expected to be the New Apps?

Though app stores are flooded with a large number of apps, a recent Nielsen analysis found that on an average, smartphone users regularly accessed just 26 apps. It is also a number that has remained relatively constant over the last two years. Roughly 75% of all smartphone users in the world use some type of messaging app – WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber or WeChat.

Day-to-day activities such as ordering groceries or checking in for a flight into these messengers is a smoother way to interact, instead of downloading a wide range of specialist apps that you use just a couple of times a year, taking up precious storage space. Chatbots are quite popular in Asian countries, where they are used to shop online, book doctor’s appointment and pay utility bills.

Facebook had earlier announced Messenger had reached 900 million monthly active users. Its other messaging app WhatsApp reached 900 million users in September 2015 and 1 billion in February 2016. It shows that messaging is a widespread habit amongst smartphone users. Chatbots are being developed to utilize this habit while making life of customers easier with the help of artificial intelligence.

In Fact, Facebook is planning to provide developers with toolkits for [customer service chatbots](http://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/08/facebook-chatbot-live-chat-messenger/) and live chat APIs. Microsoft talked on bots as a next wave of innovation, a few days after one of its bots "Tay" had to be shut down after it began spouting racist language it learned from users on social media. However, Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft says, “Human language is the new user interface" and is ready to bet big on chatbots.

#####The Challenge Ahead

The challenge for the chatbots to replace apps lies in their behavior. While the definition of “appropriate behaviour” is subjective, it may be difficult for tech companies to convince businesses to switch to chatbots.
We will surely have to wait and watch till then. Let me know what your views.
