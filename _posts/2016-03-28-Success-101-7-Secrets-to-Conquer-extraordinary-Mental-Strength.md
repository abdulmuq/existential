Our success in life is most relevantly tied to our ability to deal with stress, anxiety, failures and determination to achieve our end goals. The route to success may be long and tiresome, but with the right mindset and determination, nothing is impossible. However, in order to improve our odds to success, we need a strong mind with a clear vision, capable of strategic planning and timely execution of our plan with utmost efficiency.

Luckily, we can fine-tune our brains to achieve mental strength by focusing on positive factors of reinforcement, and blocking out agents of mental distraction. - Let me tell you how:

##### 1. Put yourself first:

Most of the times, we suffer through anxiety or stress due to excessively long work hours or not getting enough rest – While we may not notice the after effects of such a tedious lifestyle in the short term, we set ourselves to burn and crash in no time.

Thus it is crucial for physical and mental well being to focus on what puts us at ease – meditation, exercise, healthy eating, reading or even perhaps sharing our thoughts and feelings with someone who cares. Focus on what you enjoy doing and do it first thing in the morning so it sets the mood for a productive day ahead.

##### 2. Prepare a plan, but learn to deal with uncertainty:

Mental strength is heavily dependent upon being able to put a plan together for the best achievable out come, while still being able to deal with uncertainty. To keep your focus on track, prepare a plan for your day; include all the must do’s based on priorities and include what would be nice to accomplish, but not necessarily critical.  Simplify complex tasks by breaking them down into simpler, more achievable steps and set time limits on each deliverable.

In addition, given the ever-changing business environment, we can never rule out the possibility of uncertain circumstances that require immediate change of plans. Thus, its best to be flexible, acknowledge the need for change, and enjoy functioning out of your comfort zone.

As its said, “If it doesn’t challenge you, it wont change you.”

##### 3. Do not dwell on past mistakes – Learn from them:

During the course of our lives, we come across many challenges, losses and unpleasant experiences. It could be the failure of a project, financial set backs or even broken relationships. While we cannot change our past, we can achieve mental strength by learning from past mistakes, evaluating contributing factors that led to our failure, and ensuring those mistakes are not repeated again.

Excessive dwelling on past failures only gives rise to self-destructive emotions of self-pity, un-due blame, depression and anxiety. It distorts our focus from what needs to be done today for a bright future tomorrow.

##### 4. Do not give away your power:

Mental strength is heavily dependent upon the ability to stay in control of your thoughts and emotions. Our painful pasts, fears or losses may break our motivation to change our present and future, if we allow them to do so. Hence, it is critical to acknowledge the emotion of reluctance, understand and evaluate the risks involved in making choices for a calculated decision making – But do not surrender to mediocrity by giving away power to fearful thinking. 

It may seem like a challenging task at first, but with enough practice, we can train our minds to stop wandering on useless or worrisome ideas, refocus our attention on the important matters on hand, and enjoy channeling our fears into agents of strength and motivation.

##### 5. Do not ponder over what’s out of your control:

Mental strength enables us to understand that there may be circumstances that are out of our control – they may be situations that we’d not willfully want to participate in, but still need to address; or there may be people we’d not like to deal with, but still have to make an effort to keep in communication. Thus understanding that we cannot change certain circumstances or personalities, gives us the strength through acceptance and tolerance.

In simple words, mental strength lies in the ability to acknowledge such factors, but block the negativity relevant to the circumstances. Understand that they are there, but do not let it impact our overall well-being or morale.


##### 6. Cut the cords on all negativity:

Mental strength can be drastically improved if we eliminate negative, toxic energy from around us. It could be in the form of our fears, emotionally draining activities or negative people who weigh us down. 

Thus surround yourself with positive people who could keep you on track, be your strongest support system, provide honest and critical advice, and cheer for your victories. 

Learn to say no to activities that do not add positively to your lifestyle – Do not shy away from turning down request that do not align with your values or morals, since that can cause major anxiety and stress in your mind. Turn your thoughts into action based activities and focus on getting things done.

##### 7. Don’t get sucked into Social media:

As much as we all like to stay connected to the world via various social media platforms, it is crucial that we limit our exposure to them for better time management and improved focus. It is easily possible to get sucked into communicating with our friends via Facebook or WhatsApp, read Twitter feeds or follow Instagram, and the next thing we know, we have spent hours doing so.

Thus it is critical that we not let them become a distraction, rather they could be used as a reward for completing tasks on our to-do list.

In summary, mental strength involves more than just will power; it requires hard work and commitment. It’s about establishing healthy habits, and choosing to devote our time and energy to self-improvement that ultimately leads to success!

“The biggest wall you’ve gotta climb, is the one you build in your mind”.
