The FDA has just announced to waive restrictions on the availability of a new label for a common abortion-inducing drug, which could potentially impact laws on medication abortions in several states. Abortion rights groups say that the change may impact the laws in the states of Ohio, North Dakota, and Texas.

The manufacturers of the drug Mifeprex were informed by FDA earlier this week that the drug is safe to use for termination of pregnancy in accordance to the new label. The drug needs to be used in conjunction with another drug, misoprostol in order to be effective. Mifeprex causes the production of progesterone to cease, while misoprostol causes the uterus to eject the pregnancy.

Under the new label, a smaller dose of Mifeprex can be used up to 70 days into the pregnancy - three weeks longer than the previous guidelines. It also now allows nurse practitioner to administer the drugs.

The change in guidelines by FDA is facing heaving criticism by antiabortion groups who appose the easy availability of the abortion pill. However, medication-induced abortions are considered common practice by many doctors, and increasingly preferred way of terminating pregnancy by many women, compared to the typical surgical procedure.

The new label could potentially lead to more medication abortions nationally, given the easy availability of the abortion pill and flexible prescriber guidelines.
