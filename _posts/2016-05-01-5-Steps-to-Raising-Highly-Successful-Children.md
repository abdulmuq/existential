![Existential - 5 Steps to Raising Highly Successful Children](/img/5-Steps-to-Raising-Highly-Successful-Children.jpg)

Parenthood remains to be one of the most important and difficult tasks at hands for those of us who choose to have children. The responsibility does not only limit to providing them with food and shelter, but it is invaluable to give them the life-skills required to be successful both in their personal and professional lives.

Whether they are our own biological children, or we may be step or adoptive parents, the art of impactful but kind and sensitive care giving remains the same. A genuinely nurturing relationship is even more so important when you are not the biological parent in order to establish a loving and trusting relationship. Regardless, children need to be raised in a loving and peaceful environment where they feel safe and confident. 

Although there is no right or wrong parenting techniques, here are a few that are undeniably some of the most valuable ones:

#####1. Help them build Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

One of the most important life skills to be taught to children is emotional intelligence. That means instill in them the quality of empathy, teach them the importance of contentment in an ordinary life, and understand the imminent factors of life and death/loss and grief, the wonderful joys of experiencing what Mother Nature has got to offer, and teach them the art of thankfulness.

When children are dealt with at an emotional level in their early childhood, it helps them feel secure in their environment and grow into confident beings that value humanity and enjoy making an effort towards maintaining harmony in their own lives and that of others. Adults with high EQ are known to be more successful in their personal lives as they aim to avoid conflict and opt for a more peaceful outlook on life overall.

So much of attention is paid towards helping children develop a high IQ, which is equally important, but it highly critical that we help our children become emotionally strong and sensitive human beings. 

One of my all time favorite poems “Make the Ordinary Come Alive’ says just that:

*"Make the Ordinary Come Alive*

*Do not ask your children*

*to strive for extraordinary lives.*

*Such striving may seem admirable,*

*but it is a way of foolishness.*

*Help them instead to find the wonder*

*and the marvel of an ordinary life.*

*Show them the joy of tasting*

*tomatoes, apples, and pears.*

*Show them how to cry*

*when pets and people die.*

*Show them the infinite pleasure*

*in the touch of a hand.*

*And make the ordinary come alive for them.*

*The extraordinary will take care of itself."*

#####2. Provide Early Academic Skills

Engaging children in early academics is proven to be very beneficial in helping them develop interest in learning and experimenting with new skills. However, it is most important that the learning happens in a fun and casual environment, without any pressure of engaging in activities that seem to cause stress and anxiety during the process.

Incorporate simple but fun tasks into their daily lifestyle, that promotes comprehension of basic math and science concepts. Engage in reading books and celebrate creativity through art and poetry. Keep an open and positive environment where kids feel comfortable in experimenting with new concepts of learning, weather it be as simple as seeing sugar and salt dissolve into water, or the concept of robotics through putting together simple Legos.

#####3. Set High expectations

Using data from a national survey of 6,600 children born in 2001, University of California, Los Angeles professor Neal Halfon and his colleagues [discovered that the expectations parents hold for their kids have a huge effect on attainment](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/2/e440). While I am strictly against engaging children into learning under pressure, I strongly believe it is important for children to be taught to be hard working and strive towards their goals. 

Teaching them to be open and willing to function out side of their comfort zone is a critical life skill that helps promote healthy competition and a drive to achieve and excel in every aspect of their life, weather it be sports, arts, academics or a hobby.

When children are not taught to meet or exceed expectations, they only learn to function in mediocrity which is not necessarily bad, but not sufficient to achieve extra ordinary success in life.

#####4. Reinforce a ‘Growth’ mindset

Most commonly, children’s mindset can be categorized into two groups: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. A "fixed mindset" assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static, which we can't change in any meaningful way. Consequently, success is measured against fixed standards and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled.
A "growth mindset," on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of un-intelligence but as an opportunity for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. 
If kids are told that they aced a test because of their innate intelligence that creates a "fixed" mindset. If they succeeded because of effort, that teaches a "growth" mindset. Extraordinary success is heavily dependent on instilling a ‘growth’ mindset in kids so they learn to challenge their innate skills and strive towards learning and growth opportunities. So when you praise your kids, don't congratulate them for being so smart, commend them for working so hard.

#####5. Teach them the value of money

As much as we like to spoil our little ones with our love and provide all the luxuries at our disposal, it is equally critical that we teach them the value of money. Buying them gifts and toys is best when it is used as a means of positive reinforcement for good behavior or as a token of appreciation for their hard work.

On the other hand, fulfilling each and every ‘want’ of theirs does no good, and they fail to realize the importance of using the resources wisely. Encouraging them to strive towards their goal is a great way to teach them independence and the positive co-relation between hard work and reward. If they fail to engage in sufficient effort towards their goal, let them fail a few times and hold them accountable for the consequences, as that is a learning process in it self. 

It is also important that we teach them the art of ‘sharing’. Most often we observe that kids struggle to share their favorite toys with others and often this behavior is not addressed appropriately. Having them understand that there are many other children in this world who are forced to live with minimal resources, we not only teach our kids to be empathetic but also encourage sharing the resources on hand.
