Every so often, we come across people in our lives that leave a lasting impression on our minds – Why? 
Because they are impactful, likable, authoritative, and have a magnetic/positive aura around their physical presence – In summary, they are Charismatic!

Are we all born charismatic? Not necessarily. The art of charisma can be acquired and mastered through knowledge and practice. With self-awareness, sufficient effort and deliberate personification of confidence, anyone can transform from being meek to being charismatic.

Here are 5 easy steps to being charismatic - influential, persuasive and inspiring:

#####1. Loosen up – be your self:

It is most important that while you master the skill of charisma, always let your personality shine through. After all, it’s your authentic presence, skills and unique qualities that make you memorable.  
Be present in the moment and develop an awareness of your surroundings and thoughts. It is common for our thought to wander off and be caught up in unnecessary worries – make a deliberate effort to refocus your attention on peculiarities of the moment and those around you.
Half the battle against low self-esteem is won as you develop an honest understanding of your uniqueness. We all are born with very distinguished skills and qualities and learn to improve ourselves from prior mistakes, trial and error. If you aren’t failing enough in life, you are probably playing within your comfort zone. Learn to combat negative thoughts of failure or hurtful past, by being forgiving to yourself and understanding that it is ok to make mistakes.

Wish to take your awesome self to the next level? – Try being an intelligent risk taker, play out of your comfort zone, learn new skills, and set/achieve challenging goals.

#####2. Build human connections:

Living in a society characterized by relationships be it friends, family or romance, our lives are touched by human and emotional connections. For those who wish to be influential and captivating, it begins with a gesture as simple as a ‘smile’. Thus, it is always wise to be less confrontational. Give due respect to every individual and master the skill of patience and forgiveness. 
Most people around us are naturally sympathetic – they are there to learn, be inspired and support/join us on our journeys. Hence it is vital that we make a genuine effort to build strong long lasting relationships based on acceptance, tolerance and empathy. This can be best done by reaching out to help, give constructive feedback, being a good listener and developing a reputation of truth and honesty.
Contrary to popular belief, it is also ok to show vulnerability, and reach out to ask for physical or emotional help to those we trust – this is in fact a gesture demonstrating honesty and truthfulness in a relationship. In summary, charismatic people hold true to important relationships in their lives, and do not shy away from demonstrating honest expressions of love, joy, surprise, pride, fear, concern etc. 

#####3. Master the art of impactful speaking:

Impactful speaking is the most powerful tool to master, if we wish to develop a reputation of authority and influence, adding to the allure of charisma.  Impactful speakers illustrate a multi-dimensional feast for the senses of their audience, by acting in tandem with their words, body language, appearance, title, and reactions of others. 
In the process of developing this critical skill, it is vital that you eliminate all elements of self-doubt, as it can make you appear untruthful and unsure of yourself, repelling people rather than drawing them to you. Make use of your body language congruent with your speech, and you will naturally find the right tone for your audience. 
Very few people can listen and think at the same time, thus the power of truly impactful speaking comes from your silences – It is best to vary the pace of their speech and give the audience time to digest their ideas while anticipating what might be next.
In the context of influential speaking, charismatic people often make use of anecdotes, personal stories/experiences, mild sarcasm and good humor to retain the attention of their audience and come across more authentic and personable.

#####4. Selectively use the power of touch:

In an attempt to draw people to trust your words and context, nonsexual touch can be incredibly powerful. Touch can influence behavior, increase the chances of compliance, make the person doing the touching seem more attractive and friendly, and even help you establish a more trustworthy relationship.  

Via the power of physical touch, you gently intrude the other person’s private space while providing a reassurance that you mean no harm. Say you're congratulating someone, shaking hands or — possibly better, depending on the situation — patting them gently on the shoulder or upper arm can help reinforce the sincerity of your words and actions.

In the context of pursuing a romantic relationship, the impact of a gentle touch on the forearm, shoulder or upper back is known to deliver the message of your interest in a sexual context, while still respecting the privacy of touch to more sensitive parts of the body. In a more established romantic relationship, it is of course more allowable to experiment with the sense of touch to convey your affection and portray your charisma as an avid lover through the sensations of pleasure. 


#####5. Be genuine and empathetic:

While building professional and personal relationships, we're naturally drawn to people who are polite, agreeable, kind and genuinely empathetic. 

“Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge… is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another’s world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding.”― [Bill Bullard](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6426688.Bill_Bullard)

In order to increase the level of power in your charisma, it's best to combine an influential personality with warmth so you don't appear too cold or dictatorial. 

In summary, it really boils down to the qualities of self-confidence, warmth, empathy, and patience that distinguish a charismatic personality within a crowd.
