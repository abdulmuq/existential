Hillary Clinton has secured enough delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination to become the first woman to lead a major party in the race for the White House.

The nomination battle ended late Monday as she claimed exactly the number of delegates needed to secure victory in her contest against Sen. Bernie Sanders. The announcement came on the eve of the last round of state primaries.

Clinton tried to maximize vote totals in all 50 states, surrounded herself with guides who managed her image in the media and gave highly influential performances at critical events in the campaign, including first Democratic debate in Las Vegas in October.

Clinton was widely expected to clinch the nomination Tuesday, when California, New Jersey and four other states are scheduled to vote. But according to the Associated Press, Clinton continued to pick up commitments from superdelegates over the weekend, and on Monday, it effectively guaranteed her the nomination.

With that win, Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and Secretary of State has ended more than two centuries of U.S. history in which only men have been the standard-bearers for the major political parties. She also overcame her loss to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primaries.

Behind her success in the primary election was the huge network of grass-root volunteers. A team of volunteers and digital strategists built an email list of millions of supporters in all 50 states. A bus with a picture of her, traveled thousands of miles to college campuses, football games and gay pride parades. Her biggest tactical change, from her failed 2008 strategy, was employing staff in all states conducting hundreds of meetings.

In California, Clinton said, “My supporters are passionate. They are committed. They have voted for me in great numbers across the country for many reasons. But among the reasons is their belief that having a woman president would make a great statement — a historic statement — about what kind of country we are, what we stand for. It’s really emotional.”

While Sanders won virtually all caucus states, Clinton’s team relied on zonal captains and technology including a mobile app identifying winnable delegates to pull out critical wins in Iowa and Nevada.

There is a chance that Sanders will keep fighting her even now that she has become a presumptive Democrats’ nominee. He issued a statement on Monday, “It is unfortunate that the media, in a rush to judgment, are ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer.”

What makes this win even more special is the fact that Tuesday marks the exact anniversary of the day eight years ago when Clinton conceded the Democratic nomination to then-Sen. Obama. She had promised then that a woman would someday win the White House.
