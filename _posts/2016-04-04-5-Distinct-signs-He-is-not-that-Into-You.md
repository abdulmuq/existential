As much as you’d like your feelings to be mutual in a romantic relationship, it may not necessarily go your way every time. Hence it is important to understand the true reality of your relationship without over investing your time, energy and emotions. There are many queues to pick up to ensure the longevity of your relationship; otherwise he may only want to stay firmly rooted in the ‘no expectation’ zone. He may prefer to keep it casual or more friend-like, while you may get sucked into unrealistic expectation of taking your relationship to the next level of commitment.

 Unfortunately, too many otherwise intelligent and independent women spend enormous amounts of time and energy trying to convince him to like them back. However in reality, he may be openly demonstrating perfectly transparent male behaviors of *“I am just not that into you”.*

Here are 5 more distinct signs to look for:

#####1. He doesn’t make an effort to be present around you:

This is probably the biggest sign to look for – When a guy is interested in you, he will make conscious efforts to maintain a steady presence in your life. His expression of interest may vary from being a teaser to being funny or outright lover. But regardless, he will make time to be present around you to ensure his steady interest, and to avoid the risk of losing you to someone else. He’d be there to cheer you up, put up with your tantrums or whiny episodes with no explanation required. Your relationship will feel comfortable, open and honest with good communication establish between both of you.

#####2. He considers you a ‘Good Friend’:

Guys categorize their female friends into several different boxes – You may be just his friend without any romantic feelings attached because he likes to talk to you, you are funny, a good listener, you give good advice or you are just always available. All of these signs may well put you in the ‘Just Friends’ category.

Another clear-cut sign is that he feels comfortable discussing his interests or relationships with other women with you. Someone who is genuinely interested would never do that, given he understands it’s rude to do so. He may seem flirty or funny, but that may be just his personality and he may be the same with most women.

If he were to consider you more than a friend, he would share personal information about himself that he does not shares with anyone else – his passion, his worries, his likings to even his fantasies.


#####3. His body language is friendly, rather than sexy:

Making note of his body language could give you enough information on his interest in you - if he avoids eye contact, sits with his body away from you, doesn't try to keep the conversation going, or generally maintains a distance from you, you can take all of these as signs that he's not interested.

When a guy is interested in you, he will find ways to be in close physical proximity to you, he may not hesitate to establish physical contact in public by gentling caressing your back or stroking your thigh, while he sits next to you. 

#####4. He wants you available on his own time:

If a guy wants to keep communication with you on his own time, he is probably not interested in you. If he is truly interested, he will demonstrate it - If he wants to talk to you, he will reach out; if he wants to see you, he will find a way, and if he is proud of you, he will make it obvious to others you are his. 

On the contrary, if he only reaches out to you when he needs a venting session about issues at work and how much he hates his boss; but when you need to speak, he doesn't have the time or doesn’t pay attention. All these are clear signs that you may be investing your emotions in the wrong person.

#####5. He does not make an effort to get to know you:

If a guy shows no interest or excitement over finding out who you are, it’s not a good sign. When we like someone, we make a conscious effort to get to know the story of their lives, what inspires them, their passion and worries, their childhood stories, what they like and not like to eat, their hobbies, preferences in music, and the list goes on. With genuine relationships, time holds no boundaries and you may find talking to each other for hours; you look forward to hearing each other’s voice and cant wait to celebrate being together.

In summary, it is important for women to understand that making excuses or finding justifications to rationalize un-interested behavior is an effort in vein. Don’t read too much into his mixed messages or game playing tactics – Because if a guy wants you, you’ll know it. He won’t make it a mystery; he won’t try to confuse you. In fact, he’ll do the opposite; he’ll make it crystal clear that he’s interested so as not to risk losing you.
