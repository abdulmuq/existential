![Existential - Uber Announces New Perks For Drivers](/img/Uber-Announces-New-Perks-For-Drivers.jpg)

In order to keep its drivers happy, the ride sharing giant Uber announced a bunch of perks yesterday. The new initiatives give more control to drivers, making them happy.

The moves, that started being rolled out from this week, allow Uber drivers to pause new requests from coming in while they are on a finishing route. It also includes a feature that lets drivers set a "driver destination" with which they can choose a destination twice a day. For example, users can input their journey's end—the office in the morning or home at night—and Uber will then send only trip requests that fall on those routes. This facility was available to drivers of only few of the US cities, but now it will be more broadly available.

With its new pause request feature, drivers can hit pause to stop receiving new requests and then press the button again when they are ready to resume duty. The feature will be piloted later this month in several US and international cities.

The company also announced an expansion of its plan to pay drivers who wait more than two minutes for a rider and fine riders who aren't ready when their cab arrives. This move is intended to make riders catch their cab on time so that drivers don’t have to waste time waiting for passengers. Uber has been doing this in many US cities, including Dallas, Phoenix and New York since April.

Drivers can also get discounts when thy turn passengers. They can get 15% off on uberX ride on completing 10 trips in a week and 50% off an UberBLACK ride on completing 20 trips in a week.

The “Instant Pay” feature will let drivers to get paid instantly as many times as they want with GoBank Uber Debit Card for free. Uber will open more “Greenlight Locations”, which currently operate in 250 locations, to allow drivers to get in-person help when required.
The announcements were made at a time when Uber is facing tough competition from rival Lyft, which recently secured a $500 million investment from GM. Uber too received [$3.5 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-06-07/saudi-arabias-investment-in-uber-sets-a-dangerous-precedent) earlier this month.

The company's latest app update lets drivers to get the most out of their time on the road and manage their life well as the work revolves around life, and not the other way around.
