![Existential - 23 Motivational Quotes from Highly Intelligent People](/img/23-Motivational-Quotes-from-Highly-Intelligent-People.jpg)

As we struggle through the path to success, many a times we find ourselves running low on motivation to keep pushing through the hurdles and challenges that come along the way. This phenomenon is neither unusual nor incurable, and often times all it takes is a re-evaluation of our strategy, good mentorship and perhaps a few motivational quotes to boost our inner drive and morale. Here are some of my personal favorites from highly intelligent and successful people – Enjoy:

####Albert Einstein:

1. "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop [questioning](http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/9-critical-questions-incredibly-successful-people-ask-every-day.html)."
2. “Anyone who has never made a [mistake](http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/the-5-biggest-mistakes-new-entrepreneurs-always-make.html) has never tried anything new."
3. "Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."
4. "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."

8.  "[Education](http://www.amazon.com/How-Children-Succeed-Curiosity-Character/dp/0544104404/?tag=roarin09-20) is not the learning of the facts, but the training of the mind to think."
9.  "I have tried 99 times and have failed, but on the 100th time came success."
10. "You never [fail](http://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/6-ways-to-turn-failure-into-success-every-time.html) until you stop trying."

####Steve Jobs:

11. “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do."
12. "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."
13. “I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.”
