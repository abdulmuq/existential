As our lives get cluttered with physical, emotional and financial worries, we sometimes need to make deliberate efforts to keep things fresh and exciting between the sheets. Some creative thinking could help the process: experimenting out of your comfort zone, a new pair of lingerie, or just a lazy Saturday morning of rolling in bed could unlock new levels of pleasure for you and your partner.

However, keeping the enthusiasm going in sex could become more so of a challenge in long term relationships, like marriage. During the early stages of relationships, most of us can barely keep our hands off of each other, the idea of exploring each other and experiencing new togetherness, sends chills down our spine - But as time progresses, sex often becomes a mundane task.

Although having sex with a new partner is great, few can deny that there is nothing better than making love to someone you trust and hold dearly. Great compatibility and genuine feelings intensify the experience of love making, and you hit a whole different level of satisfaction in the relationship.

However, if your sex life is in need for a quick and effective make over, here are 5 simple rules to follow:

#####1. Have an open and honest sex talk:

Establish open and honest communication about your sexual preferences, as they may change over time.  Be willing and open to experiences out of your comfort zone - sometimes all it takes to make you hit a big ‘O’ is a new position, different location in your nest or perhaps acting out a fantasy. However taboo or crazy the suggestions may seem, as long as both partners enjoy it, and it doesn’t affect your relationship or anyone else negatively, you really have nothing to fear or lose. Remember – there is no way for your partner to know what you like, unless you say it – get rid of the wasteful guessing game.

#####2. Indulge in prolong foreplay:

Although sometimes a quick and easy intercourse hits the spot, make time for prolong foreplay when you can – a hot shower together, an intense body massage, a new fragrance, or perhaps lighting up a candle or two, could set the mood for some amazing sex. Caress and compliment each other’s body during this time and work towards the perfect arousal.

#####3. Preserve Sexual Tension:

If you know you can have sex whenever you want, it loses its charm. However, deliberately withholding sex for a few nights or even a week, could allow you to hit a whole new level of arousal. Plan the night well with sufficient foreplay before you hit it, and it is sure to wake up the neighbors. 

#####4. Make it unpredictable:

Try to keep the act and timing of sex unpredictable. A mid day encounter, or a surprise weekend getaway, a sultry dress on a night out, experimenting with aphrodisiacal food or drinks in bed, a sexy mid day text, or perhaps just reading passages from your favorite poetry or book together, could surely build new and exciting memories together.


#####5. Practice sexual affirmation:

Let each other know that you have enjoyed your time together and that they have done an awesome job in bed. Positive affirmation helps build confidence of your partner and encourage them to be more receptive of new ideas and suggestions. 

Also, compliment them on their sex appeal or distinct characteristics – perhaps how seductive their skin or hair smells, how attractive their body seems, or how beautiful their eyes or lips are. Positive sexual affirmation does not always need to be around sex – an unexpected kiss, a gently stroke on the back or thigh, or perhaps a warm smile could be quite sufficient to say ‘I am glad you are in my life’…
