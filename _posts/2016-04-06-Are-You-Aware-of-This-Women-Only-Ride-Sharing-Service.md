Innovative startups come into existence when somebody sees a problem as an opportunity and comes up with an idea that solves the real-world challenges.

Once such example is of an ex-Uber driver Michael Pelletz, who recently came up with an idea of a ride-sharing service for women and children under 13. Pelletz said that his company strives to fill an overlooked gap in the industry: women’s safety. It is an untapped market that existing market players Uber and Lyft ignores. 

The new ride-sharing service called, “Chariot for Women”, is set to launch around the country on April 19 and will hire women drivers only. Chariot for Women is based in Charlton, Massachusetts and has signed up for more than 1000 drivers so far. 

Pelletz stumbled upon this idea after he, as an uber driver, had a terrible experience. According to the company’s [website](http://www.chariotforwomen.com/), “A 20-something man stumbled into Michael’s backseat, incoherently babbling behind his rolled-back eyes. He would pass out, wake up, squirm violently and reach repeatedly into his pocket before passing out again.”

Horrified by this passenger, Palletz thought, “What if I was a woman? How would a woman handle that situation, especially when I was so nervous myself?”  He used to feel worried about his daughters and wife and thought, “Just one bad apple behind the wheel, and those women would not be safe at all. 3 a.m. in Boston is a candy store for predators.”
Chariot for women aims to give most secure and fun experience to its female passengers.

Surely, it seems so. The mobile app is built with all features keeping women’s security in mind. 

Every time the driver starts her day, she has to answer a random security question that changes daily to ensure her identity. When the passenger requests a ride, a safe word pops up on the driver and passenger’s phone. If the driver says the correct word, the ride may begin. If the driver doesn’t have the same safe word, the passenger knows immediately not to get into that Chariot, and will then look for the correct vehicle.

The passengers will also see a picture of their driver, car make and license plate number every time they are picked up by cab driver. The app has real-time GPS tracing system along with maps, so they will know exactly when their Chariot will arrive. 

Chariot for Women sounds like a win-win situation for both passengers and drivers. Not only female passengers will feel safer with female drivers and vice versa, drivers can make extra income too without risking their safety.
Next time, when you book a Chariot, do let us know how was your experience.
