Five-time Grand Slam Tennis star and world’s highest-paid female athlete, Maria Sharapova, 28, admitted Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open. 

In a press conference in Los Angeles, Sharapove revealed that the International Tennis Federation (ITF) had informed her that she has tested positive for a recently banned drug, meldonium. 

She’s been taking the newly banned substance for 10 years because of a variety of health concerns, including the risk of diabetes, that she said runs in her family. On January 01’16, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) added meldonium to the list of prohibited substance. Sharapova explained that she neglected to read the updated list sent out in an official email by WADA. Apparently, meldonium had been moved from the monitored list to the banned list because of its possible use as a “metabolic modulator”. 

During the press conference, Sharapova seemed regretful and apologetic for her oversight on this matter:

*“I thought it was very important for me to come out and speak about this in front of all of you, because throughout my long career, I have been very open and honest about many things,” she said. “I made a huge mistake, and I’ve let my fans down. I’ve let this sport down that I have been playing since the age of 4 and that I love so deeply.”*

She will be provisionally suspended with effect from 12 March, pending determination of the case,” according to ITF in a written statement.

Sharapova, who is currently ranked No.7, is thought to be the world’s highest paid female athlete with her involvement in extensive business deals and endorsements with brands such as Nike.  Shortly after the press conference, Nike said it was suspending its relationship with the tennis star while the investigation continues. Forbes estimated her earnings at $29.5 million for 2015, with $23 million from off-court ventures.

Sharapova’s suspension is clearly a major blow to her placement in the women’s tennis scene, and not the sort of setting she envisioned to end her tenure as a world-class sports person.

*“I don’t want to end my career this way,” she said, “and I really hope I will be given another chance to play this game.”*
