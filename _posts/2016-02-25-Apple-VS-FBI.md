The Apple vs FBI controversy recently caught huge attention from people across the world. From what is projected on TV and print media, it seems like Apple is not cooperating with the FBI in its investigation about San Bernadino mass shootings, which resulted in a disheartening loss of 14 lives in a self-proclaimed act of terrorism. One of the convicts phone, an iPhone 5c is at the root of all the debate between user’s privacy and national security.

**Is Apple’s resistance to help FBI hack San Bernadino Shooter’s iPhone justified?**

**Should Apple fight for user’s privacy even when it can be a threat to national security?**

**Should Apple compromise with the trust with which their customers buy an iPhone?**

**Is Apple playing a marketing gimmick?**

I am sure, these questions would come up in everybody’s mind who is slightest thoughtful about national security, understands its importance and knows what is digital privacy, and not just Americans.

The reason why people are being skeptical about Apple’s sincerity in helping FBI is there is general belief that everybody is supposed to cooperate with FBI if it’s about any act that threatens national security.

According to a court filing prepared by Apple, the company responded to FBI’s requests for information regarding deadly shooting in San Bernadino, on Dec 5 i.e. 3 days after the mass shooting through emergency call center. Apple was also in constant touch with government officials on how to extract data from phone. Later, Apple was asked to provide data about the convict’s emails, messages and other information related to various names and accounts. Apple could provide help on same day for all these requests.

There was also an iCloud account linked to convict’s iPhone for which Apple was issued an official search warrant on Jan 22 as a result of a request for communication and customer information earlier in December. Apple provided all data it had in possession to government on Jan 26.
Later it came to knowledge that on Dec 6, FBI had ordered San Bernardino County’s Department of Health, convict’s former employer and owner of the iPhone, to reset the Apple ID password without prior discussion with Apple. This made it impossible to utilize iCloud’s automatic sync feature to fetch backup without unlocking iPhone.

FBI is unable to hack iPhone having strong encryption mechanism to protect against attacks meant for information theft. To break into this security layer, Apple will have to develop a new operating system, which it calls GovtOS, and install on device. This would mean writing several lines of code, testing them and above all, creating a high security area to protect it from other hackers in future. Even if they want to destroy the code, it will take lot of effort to guard logs that led to its creation.

According to a rough estimate, it will cost around $100,939 and two to four weeks to deliver the project, with Apple’s best people working on it. Some experts believe that this estimate includes only the cost of building OS and not the other infrastructure required, for example, a separate high security building.

Although FBI is ready to reimburse every penny, Apple believes that complying with this request would mean allowing federal government to overreach. All major tech companies like [Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter back Apple with legal filing in FBI case.](http://recode.net/2016/02/25/google-will-join-microsoft-in-backing-apple-with-a-legal-filing-in-fbi-case/)

However, Microsoft Co-founder [Bill Gates backs FBI in its request to break into iPhone](http://www.cnet.com/news/bill-gates-fbi-apple-iphone-backdoor-san-bernardino/), citing that this is a one-off case and that FBI is not requesting any general information.
