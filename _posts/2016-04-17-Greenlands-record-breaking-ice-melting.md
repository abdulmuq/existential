We are all aware that due to the climate changes there have been various repercussions. But the seasonal melting of Greenland’s ice sheet has literally set a new record this week. According to data by the Danish Meteorological Institute, last Monday it was noted that the ice sheet was melting at a significant rate. In fact almost 12% of it was melting, and this occurred almost a month earlier than the preceding top three recorded dates. 

As climate scientist Peter Langen commented, this was impressive and they ended up checking if their models were working properly or not. According to Robert Fausto, a scientist, temperatures on the ice have been really high, reaching 10 degrees Celsius, which was typical of a very warm day in July, not in April!

This warm weather is also having a considerable impact on regions outside the ice sheet. For instance mercury reached 17.8C on Greenland’s west coast. This was one of the highest temperatures recorded in April since 1873.

Greenland’s ice sheet is considered to be a massive contributor to the rising sea levels. Between 2003 and 2010 it lost mass twice as fast as what is did during the entire 20th century. That is an incredible statement which certainly speaks for itself. It is estimated that between 1990 and 2010, the ice loss from Greenland has contributed to a rise of 25mm to global average sea level.

The sudden meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet has made the news and caught many people’s attention. However it is just one of the events that are alerting us of the climate change problems. We are bound to experience dramatic changes as time goes by.
