Facebook's quarterly revenue was up by more than 50%, easily beating the Wall Street expectations. Its wildly popular mobile app and a push into live video helped gain new advertisers and encouraged existing ones to boost spending.

The news came as big relief to investors amidst dismal performance of major tech companies like Apple, Alphabet, Twitter and Microsoft. The company's shares rose about 9.5% in extended trading to $118.39 on Wednesday, setting it on track to open at a new high on Thursday.

The current share price is at nearly three times its initial public offering four years ago.

Facebook reported first-quarter results after the markets closed. Facebook’s revenue grew 52% to $5.382 billion in the first quarter, exceeding the expectation of $5.25 billion that analysts of S&P Global Market Intelligence had polled. Mobile ad revenue accounted for about 82 per cent of total ad revenue, compared with about 73 per cent a year earlier. 

Facebook has been showing its 1.65 billion users videos that play automatically and has introduced more advertising on Instagram, photo-sharing service. Zuckerberg said users were spending more than 50 minutes per day on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. The number could be still higher if the time spent of WhatsApp is also considered. 

As more advertisers shift to web and mobile platforms from television, Facebook is expected to account for about 12% of the $186.81 billion global digital advertising market in 2016. Facebook recently expanded its live video product, rolling out new features and making it more prominent on the app to encourage users to create videos and share them. The company's net income attributable to common shareholders nearly tripled to $1.51 billion, in the first quarter from $509 million a year earlier.

Facebook also announced a proposal to create a class of non-voting shares, which will allow Zuckerberg to have more long-term control. These shares would be given as dividend to existing shareholders, thus helping Zuckerberg to sell non-voting stock to fund his philanthropy work.

If the proposal is approved by investors and Zuckerberg has a majority of voting stock, the company will effectively carry out a 3-for-1 stock split. The company will issue two shares of non-voting Class C capital stock as a one-time stock dividend for each share of Class A and Class B common stock.

Last December, Zuckerberg along with his wife Priscilla Chan pledged to give 99% of his stock to fund health, education and environmental causes as part of [Chan Zuckerberg initiative](https://www.facebook.com/chanzuckerberginitiative/).

Investors said they were not concerned that Zuckerberg would have increased control, considering company’s consistent ability to grow and exceed expectations.

When market is flooded with millions of apps available to users, Facebook’s results are quite an achievement.
