The sportswear giant Nike will continue its relationship with tennis star Maria Sharapova, despite a two year ban slashed on her last Wednesday, due to use of a banned drug.

Sharapova failed a drugs test in March this year at the Australian Open, testing positive for Meldonium. The heart disease drug only became a banned substance on January 1, 2016.

After the shocking revelation by Sharapova accepting that she had been using Meldonium, Nike and automaker Porsche had put their relationship with her on hold for a while.

Another sponsor, the Swiss watch brand TAG Heuer, had also halted discussions in March over renewing a sponsorship deal with Sharapova. Tag Heuer CEO Jean-Claude Biver said that with the two-year suspension, "We are not in a hurry anymore to sign a new contract today or this month."

The tennis champ had been using Meldonium in the last decade for health reasons. She continued to use the banned drug citing that she wasn’t aware when the substance got added to list of banned drugs. When ITF discovered this, it slashed a two-year ban on her, in response to which Sharapova said she would appeal Wednesday’s ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The ITF said that she was at "very significant fault" for failing to remain well-informed of changes to the banned substances list.

Nike has expressed an interest to restore ties with five-time Grand Slam champion Sharapova, citing that the International Tennis Federation (ITF) too found she didn’t “intentionally break” the rules.

In a statement, Nike detailed their support for the star, “Maria has always made her position clear, has apologized for her mistake and is now appealing the length of the ban. Based on the decision of the ITF and their factual findings, we hope to see Maria back on court and will continue to partner with her.”

I am sure, all of Sharapova’s fans too must be eagerly waiting to see her back on court.
