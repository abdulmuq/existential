This Monday brings along with itself summer solstice, the longest day of the year, as the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky at noon. However, what makes it even more special is its coincidence with ‘Strawberry Moon’.

The [Strawberry Moon](http://www.almanac.com/content/strawberry-moon-june-full-moon-phases-2016) is actually a full moon, but unlike its name, instead of red or pink color, it may look amber blue. The moon derived its name as it is believed that this is the beginning of time to pick strawberries in the farm. Some of the other interesting names for this full moon are Honey Moon, Rose Moon and Mead Moon.

When full moon coincides with solstice, it rises as the Sun sets and is just opposite to the Sun. The Sun gets super high and the Moon is super low, which forces light through thicker air and makes environment more humid. This chain of events is what makes the Moon amber colored. Such phenomenon last took place on June 22, 1967, and is truly a rare event.

The summer solstice is the time when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Cancer, the farthest north the sun ever moves in the sky. Hence, days close to the solstice have the most daylight of any other days of the year. This time, solstice will occur at around 6:34 pm ET, marking the beginning of the astronomical summer in Northern Hemisphere. Moving on, the top half of the Earth will remain tilted towards the Sun till the end of August. The amount of daylight will remain same for a few more days before gradually shrinking each day until the winter solstice in late December.

The Climate Prediction Center has forecasted the remaining summer to have warmer-than-average temperatures for most of the USA.
It is believed that around 25,000 people including druids and pagan will gather at the prehistoric site of Stonehenge in UK's Wiltshire to celebrate the solstice. 

A strawberry moon and solstice occurring together has hardly any real celestial significance, apart from being a moment filled with excitement and amaze for astrologers.

Well, the coincidence of solstice and Strawberry Moon is a surely a good-enough excuse to take out your telescopes and run out.
