The Solar Impulse 2, a plane fueled only by solar panels, spent two days flying across the Pacific and landed successfully in California on April 25, completing the latest leg of the first attempt to circumnavigate the world using only solar power. Solar Impulse 2 is not the first solar airplane, but it is the first to fly day and night, without any fuel, only using energy stored in its batteries.

The mission of Solar Impulse 2 is to promote clean energy, reduce world’s energy consumption, save natural resources and improve quality of life. With the looks resembling a still from a Sci-Fi movie, the unusual design of solar plane will surely help to spread the message across the world. It has a wingspan of a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet, weight of a family car and power of a small motorcycle. Solar Impulse 2 is the largest aircraft ever built with such a low weight.

The solar plane is driven by two Swiss pilots, André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard, whose journey started in March 2015 in Abu Dhabi. The total journey is divided in 13 legs.

Leg 1 – Abu Dhabi to Muscat

Leg 2 – Muscat to Ahmedabad

Leg 3 – Ahmedabad to Varanasi

Leg 4 – Varanasi to Mandalay

Leg 5 – Mandalay to Chongqing

Leg 6 – Chongqing to Nanjing

Leg 7 – Nanjing to Nagoya

Leg 8 – Nagoya to Hawaii

Leg 9 – Hawaii to Mountain View, CA

Leg 10 – North America to Mid. USA

Leg 11 – Mid. USA to New York

Leg 12 – New York to Europe

Leg 13 – Europe to Abu Dhabi

The most important stretch of the trip was the five-day journey from Nagoya, Japan to Hawaii. During the same trip, the batteries had got over-heated. The plane and its two-person crew spent 10 months in Oahu repairing the aircraft.

André Borschberg has been an engineer and entrepreneur with managerial experience, whereas Bertrand Piccard was the first person to complete a nonstop air balloon flight around the world. If all goes well, he and his co-pilot, will become the first to circumnavigate the world in a solar plane as well.

Bertrand Piccard is also the grandson of Auguste Piccard, a Swiss physicist who took a hydrogen balloon to the stratosphere in 1931 — the highest a human being had ever traveled. His father, Jacques Piccard, was the first human being to explore the deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, in a capsule called a bathyscaphe designed by him. 

Flying across the world has been tough for the pilots. They completed a risky 38,500 KM flight across a great expanse of the Pacific Ocean in 3 days, while sleeping only 20 minutes at a time inside the plane's tiny cockpit without heat or air conditioning. They also had to keep constant contact with the Europe-based control centre.

It has taken 12 years of research and development to develop an aircraft powered by environmentally friendly products and processes. Such efforts to utilize clean and renewable energy resources can open up new industrial markets and offer an opportunity for economic development, job creation and profit.

While the solar energy powered plane has surely tested human endurance, if the experiment becomes successful, it will open new chapter in the history of Aviation industry.
