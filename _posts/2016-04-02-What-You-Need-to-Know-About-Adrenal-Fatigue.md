In the age of gadgets, gizmos and cut-throat competition, stress has become a common terminology. When it comes to health and fitness, it can be detrimental to your body if you don’t control your stress.
Adrenal glands, located on top of kidneys are responsible for battling with stress. These glands regulate your metabolism, help body to respond to stress, regulate blood pressure, and produce adrenaline hormone.

When adrenal glands are made to over-work, they can show the effects of adrenal fatigue or better known as chronic stress.

Its symptoms include:

* Feeling burnt out

* Bed-ridden

* Endocrine problems

* Digestion related problems

* Feeling lethargic

* Frequent cold and fever

* Neurological problems

* Insomnia

* Weight gain

* Low self esteem

* Craving for sugar

If any of the above symptoms of adrenal fatigue sound known to you, it’s time for you to visit a psychologist as it is more of a mental disorder which affects physical health. After all, stress comes from the inability to cope up with the demands of situation. Many doctors may even fail to diagnose any particular problem with any organ of the body, as the stressed individual may not exhibit traits of a diseased body.

How to Overcome Adrenal Fatigue?

#####1. Be Alert
The problem occurs when your body is not resilient enough to fight stress, rise above it and then let it dissipate. Instead, you stay under stress, even after it’s passed. The important thing is to find a point when you think you can’t handle it further and need to work to reverse the effects of fatigue.

#####2. Learn to say ‘No’
Many people over-commit and then find it difficult to stand by their words which results in stress. So, don’t succumb to professional, social or moral pressure and learn to say ‘no’. While stretching your limits sometimes is ok, but it shouldn’t become a habit.

#####3. Exercise
Exercise regularly to remain fit, both physically and mentally. You don’t need to have a tough regime but you should definitely exercise as suits you. You can also do some yoga at home which is quite simplistic and you won’t need to hit the gym.

#####4. Nutrition-rich Diet
Nothing can substitute a nutrition-rich diet as that is what keeps our body up and running. Make sure to include enough green-leafy vegetables, protein rich pulses and fruits in your diet. Cut on coffee dose, processed food and sugar.

#####5. Time Management
Last but not the least, prepare a schedule and stick to it. Prepare your day’s activities beforehand so that you don’t have to rush at last minute.

Be patient and give enough time to your body to heal. Spend time with your family and make a habit to unwind yourself as and when needed.

Stress can prove to be very traumatic experience for you and your family if not handled on time. Be cheerful and happy to stay away from stress.
