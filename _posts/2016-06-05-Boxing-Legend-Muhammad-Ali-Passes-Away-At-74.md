Muhammad Ali, considered as “The Greatest” heavyweight boxer in the sport’s history, passed away at 74, on late Friday night in Arizona. He was hospitalized a day earlier due to a respiratory issue. Ali suffered from Parkinson’s disease since the 1980s.

Ali's mastery in the ring, his personality and social activism make him one of the most familiar sportspersons of the last century. Ali, born as Cassius Clay in 1946, began boxing training when he was 12 years old. He was first guided towards boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, when he encountered this young boy furious over a thief taking his bicycle. He told the officer that he was going to thrash the thief. The officer told him he had better learn how to box first. 

Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954. He won an Olympic gold medal in the 1960 Summer Games and defeated Sonny Liston in a stunning upset in 1964, claiming the title of World Heavyweight Championship at the age of 22. Shortly after that, Ali joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name. He converted to Sunni Islam in 1975, and then to Sufism in 2005.

Ali was known for being an inspirational, debatable and polarizing figure both inside and outside the boxing ring. In 1967, [Ali refused to be a part of the U.S. military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali#Vietnam_War_and_resistance_to_the_draft), citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. He was arrested and found guilty on draft evasion charges and stripped of his boxing title. He was banned to play boxing for nearly 3 years. In 1971, Ali appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and his conviction was overturned.

He controlled most of his press conferences and interviews, and spoke fearlessly about public issues unrelated to boxing. Ali transformed the role and image of the African American athlete in America by his embrace of racial pride. He was crowned as "Sportsman of the Century" by Sports Illustrated and "Sports Personality of the Century" by the BBC. He also wrote best-selling books about his career, including The Greatest: My Own Story and The Soul of a Butterfly.

Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years after his retirement in 1981. Family members believed boxing contributed to the disease. After his retirement, he concentrated on philanthropy and social activism.

As the news of his demise spread across the world, internet got flooded with messages expressing both shock and sadness.

President Obama too was fan of Ali and always admired his unique ability to summon extraordinary strength and courage in the face of adversity, to navigate the storm and never lose his way.
Rest in peace, Muhammad Ali.
