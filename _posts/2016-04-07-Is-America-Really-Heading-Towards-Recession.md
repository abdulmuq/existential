For at least three years, we have been hearing that America is on the verge of slipping into a recession.
But we all know it hasn't - and probably won't anytime soon. I'd like to talk about why United States is heading towards anything but recession.

Few days back, Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for president, said the nation is marching towards a very massive recession, because of an inflated stock market, high unemployment and an economic bubble.

In an interview with Washington Post, he said, *“I think we’re sitting on an economic bubble, a financial bubble.”*
But we have reasons not to believe him.

The [latest jobs data](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.htm) released by The Labor Department show that the unemployment rate is at 5% and average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased by 4 cents to $21.37. 

An entity that determines the official start and finish dates of economic contractions in the United States, The National Bureau of Economic Research,  defines a recession as a *"significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales."*

If we look at the history, recessions on an average occur every 59 months, with the average recession lasting a little more than a year. There were few reasons which sparked the fear of recession in United States such as:

*Illiquidity in the high-yield credit markets
*Slowing Chinese Economy
*Strong US Dollar
*Unstable oil prices
*Political risk (read Trump for The Presidency)

Economists believe that all economies are cyclical. They start growing slowly from prior contractions and then spread across many regions and industries. Over the period, the growth becomes more robust with more jobs. Eventually, companies can’t fill in new positions which leads to rise in wages to compete for workers. This leads to more hiring, higher salaries and more sales.

The current inflation rate – 1.7% - is far below from the recession levels. If Federal Reserve tightens interest rates in up to five consecutive meetings, chances are economy may be heading towards recession, which is not the case now.

The robust jobs data is surely a sign of growing economy, however Trump had different opinion. He said, *“First of all, we’re not at 5% unemployment. We’re at a number that’s probably into the 20s if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians – and in particular, presidents – look good. And I would be getting the kind of massive crowds and I’m getting if the number was a real number.”*

Most media persons believe that the language, in many articles claiming that America is marching towards a major recession, is not designed to inform or to describe probabilistic, data-driven models of a complex global economy; rather, it is merely an attention-seeker talk and nothing more than marketing.

So, enjoy the economic expansion. I don’t think it will end - just not as soon as the doomsters believe.
