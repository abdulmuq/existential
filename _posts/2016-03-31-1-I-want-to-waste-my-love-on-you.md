![Existential - I want to waste my love on you (Poetry)](/img/I-want-to-waste-my-love-on-you-2.jpg)



*Just when I thought I’d never love again,* 

*You walked into my faint life with transcendence of love to ease off the pain,* 

*The glimpse of you across the hall of the my favorite café,*

*Brought back remembrance of our love and laughter, down the memory lane.*

*A decade of loneliness and despair has taken its course, as time flew -* 

*But this time, I want to waste my love on you.*

-----

*I want to waste my mornings on you,*

*Silently looking at you while you sleep as I soak myself in your golden hue,*

*In your face, I see time and stress have taken a toll – But I secretly promise, my love will make up for all,*

*Let me begin by caressing your face, as I gently kiss your cheek*

*That’s the least I can do, for my love to speak,*

*I wish the moment would freeze as my feelings subdue,*

*Did I say I want to waste my love on you?*

-----

*I want to waste my days on you,*

*Catching up on a decade of silence as our distance grew,*

*Sharing stories of our untold past, painful heartbreaks and secret feelings we both knew,*

*Driving to far away altitudes where there is not a cloud to obscure the deep serene,*

*I’d like to sing to our favorite tunes, deep in the wilderness, exploring the worlds I have never seen,*

*I wish the moment would freeze as my feelings subdue,*

*Did I say I want to waste my love on you?*

-----

*I want to waste my evenings on you,*

*Letting you speak of your success and victories, as your passion grew,*

*I want to let you cry as I heal the scars life has left on you,*

*As I spoil you with my love in ways you never knew.*

*Let’s witness the sunset tonight along the crashing shore,*

*As I rest my head against your chest, witnessing the rhythm of your breathing galore,*

*I wish the moment would freeze as my feelings subdue,*

*Did I say I want to waste my love on you?*

-----

*I want to waste my nights on you,*

*Laughing on jokes that make no sense, gazing at the stars as our love commence,*

*Watching movies just half way through, enough to make our desires brew –*

*Don’t ask, don’t tell - Why you left a decade ago? This time I am not letting go,*

*Its time we sleep in each other’s arms, as with distance our fondness grew.*

-----

*The warmth of your breath across my face, the passion of your kiss has left a taste,*

*As I see you fall asleep besides my being, with comfort in your face and a rested brain - I know my job is done to heal*

*your pain.*

*Once again - Let me begin by caressing your face, as I kiss your cheek,*

*That’s the least I can do, for my love to speak.*

*I wish the moment would freeze as my feelings subdue,*

*Did I say I want to waste my love on you?*
