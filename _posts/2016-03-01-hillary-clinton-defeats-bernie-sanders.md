Hillary Clinton defeated her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders to win South Carolina democratic primary on Saturday, after her loss in New Hampshire, to set stage for Super Tuesday.

For Clinton, this was a comfortable win of a Democratic primary with a margin of 48 points. With this victory, Clinton can claim a powerful influence over black voters who could also play a game-changing role in half-dozen other southern states. On the other hand, Sanders who calls himself a democratic socialist is quite popular amongst young voters and progressives. Sanders had beat Clinton easily in New Hampshire and was quite close to beating her in Nevada and Iowa.

The victory in South Carolina will give Clinton much needed push as the contest heads toward Super Tuesday, where she and Sanders will compete in 11 states. If she wins in Super Tuesday contest too, it will be a knock-blow to Sanders.

On her victory in South Carolina, Clinton said to her jubilant supporters at a victory rally in Columbia, “Today, you sent a message: In America, when we stand together, there is no barrier too big to break. Tomorrow, this campaign goes national.”

No one had expected such a massive gap between rival candidates, but with an overwhelming 8 out of 10 black votes going to Clinton, she is all set to give tough fight to Republican Senator Donald Trump who is one of the most popular candidates in presidential race as far as popularity is concerned. Taking a jibe a Trump, Clinton said, “When you run for president, it’s not just Americans who pay attention. And when you are president the entire world listens to every word you say. Markets rise and fall, You do have to be careful about what you say and how you say it.”

Large number of black voters find Clinton trustworthy and honest, and believe that she will bring about huge improvement in education and poverty of blacks.
However, black voters had slashed Clinton in previous election, making Barack Obama the first black American President. But it seems that with vast majority of black votes, Clinton has all the strength behind her. Exit polls by ABC News showed that large majority of Democratic voters want next president to continue Obama’s policies.

Sanders told reporters in Rochester, Minnesota, “In politics, on a given night, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Tonight we lost, I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her very strong victory. Tuesday, over 800 delegates are at stake, and we intend to win many, many of them.”

In Austin, on Saturday, more than 10,000 supporters cheered every sentence of Sanders at a rally and he too had lot to say about various issues. He reminded his close tie in Iowa caucuses, big win in New Hampshire and small lag of five percentage point in Nevada.

If Clinton continues her winning streak even on Super Tuesday with support from blacks while making space amongst young voters and white liberals, the race will be all over.
