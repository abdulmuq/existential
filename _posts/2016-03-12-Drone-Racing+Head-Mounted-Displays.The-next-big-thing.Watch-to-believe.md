**What’s the next best thing to being inside a star war’s race?**

Drone Racing + Avegant Glyph (a head mounted display).

Avegant Glyph is a cool new head mounted display system that allows you to watch movies / any screen with lenses throwing light directly at your retina. It looks awkward but it works great. 

Avegant Glyph raised about $500k through kickstarter to build a head-mounted virtual display similar to Oculus Rift and its predecessors in some ways, but drastically different in several areas.

And despite FAA regulations on drone registrations, people continue to buy them. And many of them are buying drones not just to record fancy videos but to do drone racing. 

Drone racing is a new sport that is coming from drone owners where drones are driven to insane speeds. The video that comes out of it is insane and you have to watch it to believe the exhilaration that you will experience.

Combine Drone racing with a head mounted display using Avengant Glyph. 
Drone racing + a head mounted display like Avengant are the next best thing to actually being inside of drones and racing like how it happens in Star wars.
