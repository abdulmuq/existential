Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Governor John Kasich have devised a plan to deny Donald Trump the delegates he needs to win the Republican presidential nomination.

On April 24, the campaigns of Ted Cruz and John Kasich announced an agreement to organize their efforts to prevent Donald Trump from winning the GOP's presidential nomination before the Republican National Convention.

Jeff Roe, Cruz's campaign manager, said in a statement, “To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico.” He added, “Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans.”

Addressing his supporters, Cruz said, “65 to 70 percent of Republicans nationally understand that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head to head with Hillary Clinton. That if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins and she wins by double digits.”

John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist, said, “Our goal is to have an open convention in Cleveland, where we are confident a candidate capable of uniting the party and winning in November will emerge as the nominee." 

Kasich was scheduled to campaign in Indiana on Tuesday, with a town hall at the Hamilton County Fairgrounds in Noblesville and an election night party in Indianapolis. Both of those events were called off, although he will hold a fund-raiser event, as his campaign is working hard to conserve resources and finances. His most recent campaign finance report showed that he ended March with just $1.16 million cash on hand.

The move comes as U-turn from Cruz, who earlier opposed coordinated efforts to stop Trump. In past few days, both Cruz and Kasich were slamming each other in public and their teams were sparring with reporters too.

Cruz’s and Kasich’s statements prove the fact that Trump has strong chance to win 1,237 delegates in primary elections and win party’s nomination.

In reply to his opponents’ move, Donald Trump later released a statement in which he called it ‘sad’ that Cruz and Kasich had to come together to stay alive.

We would really have to wait and watch on who wins the nomination for the national election, and if the move to unite against Trump would really prove effective. However, some Republican strategists believe that such deal could be too late.
