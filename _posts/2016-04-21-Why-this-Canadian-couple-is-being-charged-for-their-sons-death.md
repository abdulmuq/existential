David and Collet Stephan of Alberta, Canada are charged with the killing of their nineteen-month-old son, Ezekiel Stephan, who had allegedly been sick for weeks before he died of meningitis in 2012. The couple is now pleading not guilty for failing to provide necessary medical attention for Ezekiel. They allegedly treated him with home remedies instead of taking him to a doctor before he died.

The Stephens run a nutritional supplement company called Truehope Nutrional Suport Inc. in Alberta, Canada, that produces natural treatments. The company has been sued in the past for distributing products without drug identification numbers and proper approval from the medical board in Canada. 

The parents allegedly originally tried to provide home treatment to Ezekiel by feeding him with olive leaf extract, whey protein, water with maple syrup and juice with frozen berries – this mixture was given to support his immune system. When his symptoms did not improve, they allegedly fed him a mixture of apple cider vinegar, horseradish root, hot peppers, onion, garlic and ginger root.

Within a few days, Ezekiel’s symptoms worsened and he was airlifted to the hospital when he stopped breathing. Doctors removed him from life support after five days in the hospital. Prosecutors argued in court that this is not a matter of the couple not loving their son or trying to kill him, but that they could have prevented his death by bringing him to a doctor much sooner.

David Stephan has been posting updates on social media claiming that the government is prosecuting the couple to force parents to vaccinate their children. 

Should he and Collet be found guilty, they face up to five years in prison and the loss of their three other children.
