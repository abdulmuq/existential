If you have been told that you are a great listener, you are talented and very nice – You my friend have entered the ‘Friend Zone’.

It is a well-known phenomenon in the dating world that although women repeated express the desire to be in a stable and committed relationship with a nice guy who would hold the door for them, there lies the deepest darkest secret of admiration and attraction towards bad boys. The compliment of “He’s nice” may actually be a polite rejection of seemingly unattractive, less adventurous and predictable or boring characteristics. Such a perception of  ‘nice’ is in direct conflict with the classic definition of the word itself – typically inclusive of the following traits: kind, emotionally sensitive and caring about others.

The more permanent long-term situation for most romantic relationships is however more positive: Research shows women prioritize physical attractiveness over kindness when describing their preferences for a short-term partner (Li & Kenrick, 2006). For long-term relationships, non-physical characteristics take precedence: Women care more about kindness and warmth and less about status and physical attractiveness.

Let’s evaluate why being nice is a detriment in the short term:

#####1. Most women are attracted to socially dominant men: 
Although most women prefer being independent and self-sufficient, they seem to relate strong dominant men with social stability and security. On the other hand, the nice guy may be perceived as "inappropriately nice and manipulative, or eager to please, perhaps even desperate, and therefore less sexually appealing”, according to Gurit E. Birnbaum, Ph.D., of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel. Thus, we see a strong preference of women opting for physical/ sexual attractiveness, and dating desirability in conjunction with social dominance.

#####2. Masculinity is intensely connected to testosterone:
Typical characteristics of bad boys include off-the-charts testosterone, social dominance, risk taking—all indicate a healthy immune system. Research suggests that in evolutionary terms, women have always had a preference to mate with healthy specimens for the sake of passing on their genes. On the contrary, a weaker man may not have been able to secure resources as readily, so he had lower mate value. Practically speaking, we’d all prefer strong children with a relatively un-involved partner to weak offspring with a dumb but devoted imbecile.
dinner and unhooking a bra at night, is alluring to such women.

#####3. Bad boys are natural charmers:
Most women have a deep desire for savvy, adventurous types and that’s just the type of personality most bad boys illustrate. Their charm lies in their mysterious ways of seeking thrill, risk and danger that boost their confidence and spike testosterone. They play hard to get and enjoy being a challenge for the women seeking their attention. Preference for such a psyche is mostly attractive for women with a mix of sweet-salty personality that are thrill seekers in their every day lives both professionally and in bed. The fantasy of a debonair charmer who's proficient at both cooking chicken for 

#####4. The Rescuer Instinct:
Some women suffer from an unusual desire to help fix the ways and means of the bad boys. They think they can handle a cocky guy and hold false expectations that they’ll be good to them while treating others like crap. Of course, that’s setting themselves up for disaster!


In conclusion, although women typically perceive nice guys as intelligent, but less assertive and less sexually experienced, they are considered stronger candidates for stronger and more commitment relationships. On the other hand, bad boys are only considered good candidates for a temporary fling until a woman is interested in establishing a steady partnership.
