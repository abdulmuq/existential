US employers added 242,000 jobs to its economy, keeping unemployment rate at 4.9%, the lowest mark during the seven-year recovery from the Great Recession.

The data came out on Friday, beating government’s expectations of 190,000 jobs. The unexpected rise in number of jobs is a sign of growing US economy amidst global slowdown. The pace of job growth indicates that people are rapidly returning to labor force which is supported by steady consumer spending leading to improvement in demand and expansion of business.

Job growth was strong in education and healthcare sectors, whereas 19,000 jobs were cut in mining sector and a total of 140,000 jobs have been lost over last year due to continued low oil and natural gas prices. Volatile oil prices and reduced demand in China have led to instability in global markets. Amongst such tumultuous times, the US performance of late might boost confidence in investors.

The reactions of job growth were seen on Wall Street, European and Asian stock markets. The S&P 500 rose 0.3 per cent to 1,999.99, having earlier touched 2,009.13, its first time above the 2,000 mark since early January. European markets posted solid gains by Friday's close, as investors cheered on the rally in mining stocks, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report and a recovery in oil prices.

With better-than-expected job data, Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again this year. However, most business analysts believe that it will take some more time to see a rate hike due to weaker global demand conditions. The dollar saw an initial rise after jobs data was released, but later fell by 0.3% against weighted basket of major currencies.

In the data released on Friday, low wages pointed to room for improvement. Federal policymakers see low wages as sign of inflation. The average hourly wages reduced by 3 cents for the month. Also, the average number of work hours in a week declined to 34.4 from 34.6. If the hourly wages improve, it would help lift US from a period of stagnation due to which many Americans feel the recovery in economy unsatisfying.

The job data of past 65 months have shown consecutive gains, 57 of them have posted more than 100,000 jobs which is required to keep pace with population growth. Taking February’s decline into consideration, wages have risen 2.2 percent over the last 12 months.

The US Federal Government has come a long way to bring unemployment rate down from 9.5% earlier. Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in an interview, “Look at new car sales. Look at the fact that more people are entering the labor market. They’re buying homes. They’re going out to dinner. These are all indicators of an economy that continues to move in the right direction and weather the headwinds.”

On Friday afternoon, President Obama citing economy’s performance said that American businesses were creating jobs at “fastest pace since 1990s.” He also added, “The American people should be proud of what they have achieved, because this speaks to their resilience, innovation, creativity, risk-taking and grit.”

US jobs data shows the sentiment of cautious optimism over health of the economy. With rising number of job openings, the Federal Government has surely reasons to cheer!
