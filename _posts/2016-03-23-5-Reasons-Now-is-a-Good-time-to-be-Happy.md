Although happiness is a subjective word, often tied to our emotional intelligence, positive thoughts, and the power to shift our focus out of negative emotions – it is seldom celebrated in the prevalent times. Most of our energies and thought patterns are either focused on the remembrance of yesterday or anticipation of the future.

In doing so, we fail to train our conscious mind to celebrate the present and enjoy the experience of being in the moment. 

Here are 5 reasons we need to make a deliberate effort to be happy ‘now’:

#####1. Now is the only time things can happen:

So much of our time is spent either on regretting the mistakes of our past or planning for the anticipated future. However, in reality we have next to none control over either of the two, and unnecessary pondering only leads to anxiety. What can truly impact our lives are the actions of ‘today’ that lead to real experiences of happiness. Hence it is important to identify and indulge in what truly makes us happy - For some it could be as minor as enjoying the pleasure of a warm cup of coffee on a cool morning, to others as major as achievement of professional goals.

#####2.  Avoid the trap of living on autopilot:

Many a times, our lives fall pray to monotonous schedules leading to dis-satisfied and unfulfilled lives. The anticipation of a ‘future date’ when we’d finally be happy causes us to be insensitive towards what’s good around us today. We may be overly focused on our careers or be stressed out due to personal finances, making us lose focus of the bigger picture – what is it that truly makes us happy? 

Perhaps picking up a hobby that we’ve always wanted, spending time with someone we adore, or even as simple as watching the orange sunset by the beach could be true sources of happiness. Can’t do any of that – just close your eyes, take a few deep breathes and enjoy the state of your existence!

#####3. Enjoy the process leading to persistent happiness:

Sometimes the route to contentment may be a process that requires deliberate training of our worried minds, until it becomes second nature. For some of us, our minds could be a battle filed of competing ideas and plans to achieve our next big victory – while there is absolutely nothing wrong with setting challenging goals and planning for the future, we should continue to cherish the sensitivity of humanly emotions during the process. What that means is that we make an effort to enjoy the experience of being ourselves, being helpful, being empathetic and influential, being grateful and above all, being present!

#####4. Mindfulness leads to better results:

Mindfulness is the conscious state of focusing and celebrating the present moment. Once we have achieved the state of mindfulness, it is up to us whether we see our lives as glass half full or half empty. By avoiding the fixation on what we don’t have in our lives, we learn to be grateful for all that we have – Good health, our friends, family, perhaps a romantic relationship etc. 

Mindfulness also enables us to consciously step away from people and circumstances that are toxic to our well being, and engage with beings and moments that bring us joy and contentment – This may be a difficult practice for some, but the rewards are endless!

#####5. Happy people are healthy people:

As humans, we experience anxiety in our daily lives due to stressful jobs, failed relationships, unfulfilled dreams or past failures – and it is completely normal to fall pray to depression and anxiety. However, by incorporating the techniques of persistent practice and mindfulness, we can conquer our anxieties and improve our overall well being.

Some of us may need assistance during the process, so its ok to ask for help – perhaps reach out to a friend or mentor, or a significant other who owns our hearth, or a gently voice that may be comforting and soothing to our soul. 

There are always new opportunities to be happy, hence to regret over past failures or ponder excessively on anticipated future, are efforts in vein. If we look close enough, chances are the opportunity to be happy has already arrived - Sometimes it’s right in front of us but we fail to realize it or chose to deliberately ignore it out of fear or hesitation. What’s required of us is to shift our focus on the opportunity in front of us; feel happier, more productive and forgiving to our selves and enjoy the process to attainment of happiness. 

Don’t wait for the perfect moment, take the moment and make it perfect!
