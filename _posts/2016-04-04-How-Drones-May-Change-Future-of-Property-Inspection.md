Now you won’t need to go in person to have an idea of property you are planning to buy. Drones will do all the hard work for you. 
State Farm is the first insurer to gain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval for commercial use of drone which may help pave the way for widespread commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles.

With this approval, State Farm has launched hundreds of experimental drone flights for routine roof inspections. If it works out, the company could eventually use drones to get an overview of catastrophes. Insurance Adjusters won’t need to climb damaged unsafe rooftops. 
Property inspection by drones is not just convenient and economical, it also offers high resolution images which can be viewed any time in future.

Apart from property inspection, drones can be used for number of purposed such as,

	*Search & Rescue
	*Security
	*Power Infrastructure Inspection
	*Surveillance
	*Science & Research
	*Aerial Photography & Video
	*Surveying / GIS
	*Logistics

Of course, the areas of application are not limited to these few examples. If other insurance companies adopt the use of drones like State Farm, it might change the way we look at property inspection.
