Although intelligence, talent and determination to exceed par excellence are pre-requisites to a successful and accomplished personality, most often, the most pleasing of individuals are gifted by the unique and invaluable quality of ‘Emotional Intelligence’ (EQ). 

Likable people make use of their EQ to illustrate a charismatic personality to positively influence others, and understand the importance of relationship building. Consequently, their strong inter-personal relationships and positive outlook, increases their chances for happiness and success in life.

Fortunately, being likeable can be a learnt trait – let me show you how:

#####1. Be genuine and honest:

The most critical of all human qualities is that of being genuine and honest. It doesn’t take too long to identify people that are fake or pretentious; hence they most often struggle to maintain long-term relationships due to their weak credibility. 

Likable people are true to them selves, stick to their morals and conscience, and always believe in doing what’s ‘right’, rather than altering their choice of actions and words based on what would please others.  They are trust worthy and honest in giving advice with the best of intentions.

#####2. Leave a strong first Impression:

Research shows that most people develop an opinion about whether they like you or not in the first seven seconds of the meeting and they spend the rest of their time trying to justify their opinion. Hence, first impressions are critical in leaving a lasting impression. 

It is also true that how you say something can be more important than what you say – Hence first impressions are dependent upon both: positive body language and strong communication skills. For example:  a warm smile, strong posture, a firm handshake; along with fun, interesting and honest conversation always make people memorable. 

#####3. Be a good listener:

Most people like to be influential speakers – they engage in conversations that most often depict their intelligence, accomplishments or extra ordinary life experiences – By doing so, they opt to influence or convince others of their uniqueness. Although there is nothing wrong in doing so, it is equally important to be an alert listener.

How to improve your listening skills? - Be in the moment, put your phone away, refocus your attention back to the conversation if you are distracted, maintain eye contact, acknowledge point of views, share ideas and make the other person in the conversation feel important.

#####4. Greet people with their names:

Since name is an integral part of our identity, it is always fruitful if we can make an effort to address people by their name, during a conversation. Not only does it make them feel important but also establishes a validation factor based upon sincerity. It helps to establish a comfort zone where people are willing to trust you more than an acquaintance. 

It also helps to confirm the correct pronunciation of a name by asking, if you are unsure of it already – People appreciate when you make an effort to say their name correct. Of course, none of us would feel important if we have to repeat our names to people we have met multiple times.


#####5. Be helpful and dependable:

Positive social connection is the greatest predictor of long-term happiness and it is highly dependent on the factor of empathy. People with high EQ are most helpful and make an effort to build a repo of dependability.  They do not hesitate to offer help, however small or big it may be with zero expectations in return.

They feel the pain of others and make conscious efforts to make other’s lives easier and more peaceful.

#####6. Make everyday count:

Likable people make an effort to indulge in small acts of kindness every single day. They get a kick out of bringing a smile to someone’s face or wipe off tears of those who may be suffering.

Their acts of kindness could be as small as: paying for someone’s coffee, hold the door for a stranger, over tip, pay someone a compliment or just crack a subtle joke to lighten the mood of those around.

#####7. Be a positive influencer:

Likeable people touch the lives of those around them in many ways, being a positive influencer being one of the most important one. They aim to spread happiness around by providing guidance and sincere advice to those in need. They may act as a professional life coach, a mentor, a friend or simply a reliable support system to lift up the sprits of others.

#####8. Have a good sense of humor:

Likable people are blessed with a gentle but respectful sense of humor that they use to spread laughter and joy around them. Their charismatic personalities make people positive and happy, while forgetting their worries even momentarily. 

They do not hesitate to laugh upon them selves and are most often successful in maintaining healthy and successful relationships – Who doesn’t enjoy the company of someone who can make use of gentle sarcasm or witty humor while being an honest friend or strong support system.


#####9. Be courteous and grateful:

People with high EQ are most often very humble and grateful in their demeanor – they recognize the efforts of those who help them accomplish their goals and are consequently always willing to help others achieve theirs. They are team players and believe in collaborative efforts. 

They are quick to express thankfulness and do not hesitate to say sorry, when they are at fault. They understand that their egos do not need to come in the way of strong relationship building. 

#####10. Smile Often:
 
Likable people have a certain aura of positivity around their personalities that pull people towards them. They are warm, kind and personable beings that lighten up the room with their presence, and capture the hearts of others through their infectious smile 

In summary, it does not need to be such an effort to become a likable person if we develop the traits of honesty, sincerity and genuine empathy, while touching the lives of people around us with love and kindness.
