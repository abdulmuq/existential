Who are the men and women in America whom people hold in highest regard?
Any idea?

[YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/05/07/wma-2016/) recently conducted a survey to find out who are the people most admired in U.S. Well, many of you may have guessed it right, but some may have been taken for surprise for few of the entries in the list. 

Barack Obama, President of The United States of America and First lady, Michelle Obama must have been your obvious choices and they actually did top the list in their respective categories!

Barack Obama got an admiration score of 10.3%, putting behind Pope Francis and Bill Gates with an admiration score of 8.2% and 6.5% respectively.

Amongst women, Michelle Obama scored 7.5% ahead of Hillary Clinton with 6.0%. There was a close competition between later and Ellen DeGeneres, who got 5.9% admiration score. What could have been a surprise for many, was the name of a Pakistani girl, staying in UK and working for the fundamental right of education of children in Pakistan - Malala Yousafzai - in the list.

Another interesting aspect of this survey could be the comparison of Donald Trump, having an admiration score of mere 4.1% with that Hillary Clinton. It may point to the fact that people like Clinton more than Trump, and that she has fair chances of becoming America’s next President.

YouGov had also conducted an online research across countries contributing nearly two-third of world’s total population. Bill Gates was named the most admired man and Angelina Jolie the most admired woman in the world. It can be implied from the survey that the world values humanitarian efforts more than politics.
