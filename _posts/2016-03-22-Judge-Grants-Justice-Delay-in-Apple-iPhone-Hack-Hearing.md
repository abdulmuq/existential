In a controversial case that FBI had filed against tech giant Apple, the U.S. Department of Justice had requested to postpone crucial hearing regarding Apple iPhone Hack. The move came in while FBI is in mid of testing a new method for unlocking iPhone of San Bernardino terrorist convict.

US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym said she founded her decision on new information that the US government may be able to access convict's phone without the help from Apple. She ordered the government to file a status report in the case by April 5.

Court documents filed late Monday, by Justice lawyers, claimed that an undisclosed "outside party" demonstrated a "possible method" to the FBI for unlocking convict’s iPhone 5c, recovered in the aftermath of the December massacre that left 14 dead.

Justice lawyers said in a three-page filing, "Testing is required to determine whether it is a viable method that will not compromise data on convict’s iPhone, If the method is viable, it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple Inc."

Justice spokeswoman Melanie Newman said, "Our top priority has always been gaining access into the phone used by the terrorist in San Bernardino. With this goal in mind, the FBI has continued in its efforts to gain access to the phone without Apple’s assistance, even during a month-long period of litigation with the company.  As a result of these efforts, an outside party demonstrated to the FBI this past weekend a possible method for unlocking the phone.”

Newman said, “We must first test this method to ensure that it doesn’t destroy the data on the phone, but we remain cautiously optimistic. That is why we asked the court to give us some time to explore this option.  If this solution works, it will allow us to search the phone and continue our investigation into the terrorist attack that killed 14 people and wounded 22 people."

On being asked more information on who the “outside party” was, FBI denied to disclose further details. Justice officials Monday also refused to elaborate on where the testing was taking place. An official, who refused to reveal his identity, said the third party had approached FBI with a potential solution and that was already under testing phase.

Tim Cook said during the [launch of iPhone 5se](http://www.cnet.com/products/apple-iphone-se/), "For many of us, the iPhone is an extension of ourselves. We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy. We did not expect to be in this position, at odds with our own government. But we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we owe it to our country. We will not shrink from this responsibility."

The entire case that has rocked both the nation and tech community has been full of controversial developments. Earlier, [Apple was resistant to help FBI hack San Bernadino Shooter’s iPhone](http://existential.us/technology/trending/2016/02/25/Apple-VS-FBI.html) after Apple disclosed that doing so will raise serious security concerns for all its users apart from the high infrastructure and operational cost. Apple deemed it unfeasible to cooperate with FBI to help them hack shooter’s iPhone. Not only that, some of the Apple executives threatened to quit if subjected to forcefully hack convict’s iPhone.
