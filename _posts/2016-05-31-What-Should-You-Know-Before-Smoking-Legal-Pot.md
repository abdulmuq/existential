Use, possession, sale, cultivation, and transportation of legal pot (cannabis) is illegal under federal law in the U.S. However, if a state passes a law to decriminalize cannabis for recreational or medical use, they can do so, under the condition that a regulation system for cannabis is in place.

Now, voters have reversed the rules in Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington. The District of Columbia has fully legalized recreational and medical marijuana, but recreational commercial sale is currently blocked by Congress.

According to [ArcView Market Research](http://www.arcviewmarketresearch.com/), the cannabis market will increase by 25% in 2016. It is also predicted that the legal cannabis industry will reach $22 billion by 2020. In 2015 alone, sales of legal pot grew to $1.2 billion, which is more than three times than that in 2014, excluding $4.5 billion brought in from medical marijuana sales.

But before you plan to buy pot and smoke, below are few things you should know. Things are more complicated if you want to sell it.

1. Medical marijuana is legal in 24 states and D.C.
2. You can be fired for smoking marijuana in some states.
3. Due to heavy taxes on legal pot, lot of it is sold in black market at cheaper rates.
4. Smoking marijuana in public is banned everywhere.
5. All transactions are carried out in cash, which makes legal pot business a highly insecure one.

Recently, banking woes have been easing for some legal pot businesses in Colorado, Washington state and Oregon. But it has made life of state authorities tough to collect taxes in cash. When Oregon began taxing recreational pot in 2016, it raked in $3.5 million in its first month, with payments ranging from $7,000 to $100,000, all in cash. Hence, Oregonâ€™s Department of Revenue had to transform small, unused office space into a high-security operation with bullet-proof payment windows, deploy police security and staff to carry out cash-counting process that ends with armored cars transporting the pot cash daily to the state's bank.

Colorado and Washington state has put security cameras, secure payment windows and cash-counting machines in place when recreational sales taxes began in 2014, and Alaska too has similar plans for next year.
