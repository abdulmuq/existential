The tiny Yorkshire Terrier, called ‘Cheeto’ by her owner Diane Weber, is a therapy dog at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin. She is as cute, small and sweet as kids, but healthier than later. 

She is utilized by the Hospital staff for kids under pet therapy. It works wonder for those who need to distress and smile more often. Cheeto, weighing just 8 pounds, is trained to make feel good to patients and not harm anybody.

Her compact size allows her to sit on bed with young patients while they enjoy playing with her, petting her and shaking hands with her. Cheeto is taught to only kiss the kids’ hands, but never lick their faces. Cheeto and Weber spend about two hours a day, twice a week, at the hospital.

Cheeto’s journey of healing people with her adorable looks started with Weber. Weber was left alone at home, after her two kids moved out to start their lives. That’s when her kids got her mom a pet dog so that she doesn’t feel lonely. Weber really loved her pet who got along very well with everybody in the neighborhood, especially children. She was then sent to pet therapy school and became a trained therapy dog.

Now, Cheeto helps kids in hospital to be free from stress and anxiety. She changes their mood and brings smiles on their faces, something much needed to recover faster.

At the children’s hospital, she not only spends time with kids, but also play with doctors, who ironically are patients themselves, suffering from high stress! 

Surely, stress doesn’t consider someone’s age and profession before hitting, and so does Cheeto’s therapy. Her calm nature and love wins everybody’s hearts. No doubt, she is so dear to all!
